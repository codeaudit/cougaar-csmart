# Sample Unix/Linux configuration file for the AppServer
# 
# Edit the claspath, install-path and config-path to reflect your 
#   local installation.  See "java.util.Properties" for syntax details.
#
# CSMART will add some properties to this list, such as the 
#   "org.cougaar.node.name=..", but otherwise this is the *complete*
#   list of properties.
#
# One can use just this ".props" file and ignore the AppServer's
#   "Warning: couldn't load properties from: 'Common.props'."
#   and similar "Linux.props" warning.
#
# Note that some symbols, such as ";", must be encoded ("\;")

# Set the cougaar install path
org.cougaar.install.path=/opt/alp

# Set the class path for starting the Node, which uses ":" separators
#
# Typically only core.jar needs to be in here.
java.class.path=/opt/alp/csmart/tmpdir\:/opt/alp/lib/csmart.jar\:/opt/alp/lib/core.jar

# Set the config path, which uses ";" separators
org.cougaar.config.path=/opt/alp/csmart/data/common\;/opt/alp/configs/common

# Set a couple other standard properties
user.timezone=GMT
csmart.log.severity=PROBLEM
org.cougaar.domain.planning.ldm.lps.ComplainingLP.level=0
org.cougaar.message.transport.aspects=org.cougaar.core.mts.StatisticsAspect

# Some standard memory settings
java.Xms100m 
java.Xmx300m

# Default to localhost popups, which also requires that localhost
#   have "xhost +localhost" for local X authorization.
#
# In general, the CSMART UI will be on host "csmarthost" with multiple
#   server hosts, "serverhost[1-N]".  For the display to work (AWT, 
#   Swing, etc) each "serverhost[1-N]" needs "env.DISPLAY=csmarthost:0.0" 
#   and the CSMART UI host needs "xhost +serverhost1 .. +serverhostN" 
#   (or just "xhost +").
#
# On some machines you may need to use the full machine name.
env.DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
