Instructions for updating a CSMART database	January, 2002

These are instructions for updating an older 8.6.2 CSMART MySQL
database with an 8.8 or better CSMART MySQL database. This is recommended to get
proper Classes 4,5, and 9 functionality.

If you do not have any complicated experiments or recipes to preserve,
simply follow the instructions in the Installation guide -- just load
the data dump file contained in CMT-MySQL.ZIP.

However, if you have one or more Experiments which you wish to save,
these instructions will walk you through doing that.

1) Export the experiments you wish to save
Use the scripts provided in csmart/bin, running from a machine with
MySQL and Linux or Cygwin installed. 
./exportExperiment.sh [Experiment name to save] [user] [pw] [db name]
[optional: host of mysql db]

Note that exported experiments will include any associated recipes,
and the experiment will be renamed [old name]-exprt

(Repeat for all such experiments, plus any recipes not included in the
above experiments.)

2) Load the new database, following the instructions in the Install
guide. Something like:
mysql -u [user] -p[pw] [csmart db name] < 1ad_full_dump.sql

3) Import your experiment export into the new database. Something
   like:
mysql -f -u [user] -p[pw] [csmart db name] < MyExperiment-export.sql

4) Run CSMART. If the old experiment is listed in your workspace,
   delete it from your workspace _only_. Then, load the experiment
   from the database. However, when you get the dialog box showing all
   the threads selected in the experiment, Select the "Force
   Recompute" box. Click OK.

   This will DELETE the CMT (basic society) assemblies for your
   experiment from the database, and re-compute them - exactly as
   though you had changed the set of threads which you wanted to
   run. This is the piece which allows your saved experiments to take
   advantage of upgrades to the reference portion of the CSMART
   database.

You will see in the background something like:
Force Recompute Checked
Deleting CMT assembly: CMT-TINY-1AD-TRANS-STUB-CFW-GRP{ST1}-SRA-exprt for experiment: EXPT-0001-SRA-exprt
new CMTasb is: CMT-TINY-1AD-TRANS-STUB-CFW-GRP{ST1}
Deleting CMT assembly: CMT-TINY-1AD-TRANS-STUB-CFW-GRP{ST1} for experiment: EXPT-0001-SRA-exprt
new CMTasb is: CMT-TINY-1AD-TRANS-STUB-CFW-GRP{ST1}
org.cougaar.name.server=null

5) If you had previously run the switchPlugin-class or otherwise
   edited the database, your changes have been lost. You must re-apply
   these changes. (For example, run switchPlugin-class to get the SRA
   plugins.)
