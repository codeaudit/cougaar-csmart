csmart/doc/CSMART-Troubleshooting.txt

Here are some tips for solving some common problems. In general, you
should make sure that you can run minitestconfig, and view the data
from a servlet, before worrying about CSMART specific items. If your
problem is not addressed here, send a query to
cougaar-developers@cougaar.org.

Errors starting society
- The single largest problem users run into is an error message about
"Unable to contact appserver" or some such. You should:
0) Make sure you started the AppServer on the machine it is trying to contact
1) Avoid hosts named "localhost" in the Experiment Builder
2) Try using IP address or fully qualified hostname in the Experiment
Builder
3) Ensure you can do an "nslookup <appserver host name as specified in
Experiment Builder>" from the CSMART machine to the
AppServer machine
4) Make sure you can do a reverse nslookup from the CSMART machine of
the IP/name returned by the above nslookup, and get your original name
5) Do the same nslookups, but this time from the AppServer machine to
the CSMART machine.

Upgrade related issues
- Note that the database schemas have changed, and the required
properties in the AppServer system.props files have changed in recent
versions. Please look carefully at the install instructions and sample
server properties files. When in doubt, reload your database.

Running CSMART
- Ensure that bootstrap.jar is on your CLASSPATH
- Ensure that all jar files are from the same build
- When you get a message at startup on STDOUT that says SHOUT [CSMART] - CSMART 10.0 built on.....
This is not an error, but normal operation.
- Messages about not finding Hosts.txt can be ignored. This is common.

Running the AppServer
- Ensure that the Classpath for the Server, and as defined in your server
properties file, and for CSMART itself, includes the same copy of bootstrap.jar
- Ensure that you edit the Server startup script to point to your
installation specific server properties file.
- Be sure that your versions of all jar files
are all from the same build (this results in RMI exceptions
occasionally).
- On Windows, be sure to set env.SYSTEMROOT in your props file

Linux Specific Issues
- Various display issues have been noticed on Linux Systems.
Some of these include:
  * Windows opening very small
  * Menus displaying incorrectly
  * Drag and Drop acting funny
Installing the Linux Blackdown JVM seems to have addressed many of the above
issues. http://www.blackdown.org
- If you have errors loading the CSMART database, for example "ERROR
13" messages, use the "local" option to the MySQL data load
script. See the description in the CSMART-KnownIssues document.
- See Linux Issues in Database section


Other common setup problems:
- If on startup you get an error like:
     SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on localhost:3306. Is
     there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you are trying to
     connect to? (java.net.SocketException)
You should confirm that you started your MySQL database at that host/port,
     and that your database permissions are configured to allow access
     from "localhost" in both the "db" and "user" tables. See the
     MySQL documentation.

- CSMART can contact your database just fine (load an experiment,
  configure it, etc), but your nodes cannot --
  you get errors in the node output windows like: 
    SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on 207.106.41.23:3306.
    Is there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you are trying
    to connect to? (java.net.SocketException)
    Possible busy server. Retrying....
1) Make sure that your AppServer server.props has a correct value for
  env.SYSTEMROOT (none on Linux, and your Windows install directory on
  Windows)
2) Make sure you have the same cougaar.rc(or .cougaarrc) file on all your node
  machines as on your CSMART machine, and only one such file (check
  $HOME, $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH and
  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/common)
3) Finally, check the user access permissions inside the MySQL
  database. See your MySQL documentation about the 'USER' and 'DB'
  tables.

- If on startup you get a JDBC error like:
java.sql.SQLException: Unknown driver driver.mysql//localhost
then make sure your JDBC connection string is correctly formatted.
For mysql: jdbc:mysql://localhost/configdb
For Oracle: jdbc:oracle:thin:@myhost:1521:cougaar
- If in configuring a host/node/agent mapping, you get an error like:
SQLException query: DROP TABLE `TMP_CMTA_CSHNA-0001`
java.sql.SQLException: General error: Access denied for user: 'soconfig@
localhost' to database 'cougaar'

Then the permissions for your database user must be expanded to
include permission to drop tables. See your database administrator or
MySQL documentation.

- If once running you get the following exception in the Node output
  stream, you are using a MySQL database without the Cougaar domain
  database installed in database "cougaar". Check your cougaar.rc file.:
org.cougaar.core.node.InitializerServiceException: java.sql.SQLException: General error: Table 'cougaar.geoloc' doesn't exist
	at org.cougaar.core.node.DBInitializerServiceProvider$InitializerServiceImpl.translateAttributeValue(DBInitializerServiceProvider.java:485)

Recipe Queries not available:
- You have written your own recipe queries, but they are not available
when building your recipe?
  Did you name the recipe "recipeQuery<Something>"? All recipe queries
  must start with "recipeQuery", case sensitive.

  Did you put the recipe query in CIP/csmart/data/common/PopulateDb.q? If
  so, have you since updated you Cougaar installation (over-writing
  any queries you included there?)

  Otherwise, did you put the recipe query in a file called
  recipeQueries.q? Is that file someplace on the ConfigPath (ie
  CIP/csmart/data/common or CIP/configs/common or the directory from
  which you launched CSMART)?
  It must be to be found.

  If you put the query in any other file, it will not be found.

Running a Society Created from Files
- When running a society you created from files, you will often have
extra files that the society will need at runtime (OPLAN related
files, files to create NSN Assets, etc). These files must be available
on your org.cougaar.config.path as specified in your AppServer
server.props file on each machine on which you will run part of this
society. For example, to run small-135 through CSMART, you will still
have to have available on your org.cougaar.config.path the various
'.xml' files found in CIP/configs/examples/small-135, but your society will not
use the '.dat' or '.ini' files. 

- If while running minitestconfig you get an error
like: 
Error parsing file: MCCGlobalMode.ldm.xml
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.xerces.framework.XMLParser.parse(XMLParser.java:1094
        at org.cougaar.util.ConfigFinder.parseXMLConfigFile(ConfigFinder.java:308)
        at org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.ldm.LDMXMLComponentPlugin.parseXMLFile
This indicates that you have old files in your configs/common. Delete
the file configs/common/MCCGlobalMode.ldm.xml on all machines, or more
completely, re-install cougaar into a fresh directory to ensure no
old files remain.

      
Be sure to check the Cougaar Bug list for known issues, at http://www.cougaar.org/bugs 
If all else fails, send a query to cougaar-developers@cougaar.org

----------------------

Other, less common issues:

Showing a Society Monitor Graph
-- If you get an error about inability to find dot, or to determine
your OS, then you should make sure that dot.exe or dot-l386 are
installed in CIP/csmart/bin. Use dot.exe on Windows, dot-l386 on Solaris or
Linux (may also work on other Unix variants, not supported). If you
believe you are running one of those OSes, and get an error message
claiming your OS was not understood, please submit a bug including the
full OS type ("uname -a" or equivalent) for your system, to the
Cougaar bug tracking site on www.cougaar.org, under the CSMART,
Society Monitor section.
-- If you get a warning dialog about an inability to contact a number
of Agents, you should first make sure that the required
CSMART_Servlets are included in your Agent definition. Then see bug #1241.

Running the Society Monitor Standalone
- Be sure to use one of the supplied Monitor start-up scripts which set up the CLASSPATH correctly.
- Ensure that you have included all of the CSMART servlets from
csmart/data/common/servlets.txt in your agent configurations

Running one of the supplied pre-configured Societies or using the
included Metrics
- If you see an error like FileNotFoundException, Node00.ini not
found, then make sure that your org.cougaar.config.path as specified
in your AppServer properties file ends with an (escaped) semi-colon,
to ensure that the current directory is on the search path.
- If you see an error about the Mylib library when running
SingleCluster or running a society with the BasicMetric included, an
error something like:

CpuClock exception: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no mylib in
  java.library.path

this indicates that the metrics Plugins could not find the named library,
available in scalability/bin. If on a Windows or Linux i386 machine, be sure
this libary is in a directory on your path. Otherwise, you may safely
ignore this error.

Running any other society
- If on Windows you get an error at startup:
Error: no `server' JVM at `C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.0\bin\server\jvm.dll'.
then you are running the JRE version of Java 1.4
You must instead run the full JDK version of Java. To do so, edit your
machine's system PATH environment variable, and put %JAVA_HOME%/bin on
your path before %SYSTEMROOT%/system32 (ie D:\JDK1.4\bin before
C:\WINNT\system32).

- If on start you get an error:
   Table cougaar.EXPT_EXPERIMENT doesn't exist on Unix, then you
   do not have the lower_case_table_names variable set to 1.  Check
   with
   % mysqladmin variables
   If you do not have it set, edit /etc/my.cnf to include the line:
   set-variable   =   lower_case_table_names=1
   and restart your server, as per the Install instructions.
   
An alternate cause, is that you do not have a current MySQL Server
(3.23.45 or greater for Unix)

- If you get the following exception, you have an invalid cougaar.rc file or
  cougaar.rc file conflicts (Running a server on Windows and Linux).

SQLException query: SELECT A.COMPONENT_NAME COMPONENT_NAME, C.COMPONENT_CLASS 
COMPONENT_CLASS, A.COMPONENT_ALIB_ID COMPONENT_ID, C.INSERTION_POINT, 
H.INSERTION_ORDER INSERTION_ORDER FROM ALIB_COMPONENT P INNER JOIN 
ASB_COMPONENT_HIERARCHY H ON P.COMPONENT_ALIB_ID = H.PARENT_COMPONENT_ALIB_ID 
INNER JOIN ALIB_COMPONENT A ON A.COMPONENT_ALIB_ID = H.COMPONENT_ALIB_ID 
INNER JOIN LIB_COMPONENT C ON C.COMPONENT_LIB_ID = A.COMPONENT_LIB_ID WHERE 
H.ASSEMBLY_ID in () AND C.INSERTION_POINT LIKE 'Node.AgentManager.%' AND 
INSTR(SUBSTRING(C.INSERTION_POINT, LENGTH('Node.AgentManager.') + 
1), '.') = 0 AND P.COMPONENT_NAME = 'SMALL_1AD' ORDER BY INSERTION_ORDER
java.sql.SQLException: Syntax error or access violation: 
You have an error in your SQL syntax near ') AND C.INSERTION_POINT LIKE 
'Node.AgentManager.%' AND INSTR(SUBSTRING(C.INSERTI' at line 1


Starting a Society from the Experiment Controller
- Ensure you've followed all the tips on running the Server above
- Be sure that the name of the host you've asked a Node to be started
on is either an IP address or the fully-qualified host name
- Be sure that you can resolve the host name into an IP address
- If running Nodes on more than one machine, try running
minitestconfig split among those machines, and ensure that that works
- Be sure that you can connect to the database using the appropriate
username and password from a command line tool.
- If a running Node in an Experiment contains the exception:
Xlib: connection to "servername" refused by server
Xlib: client is not authorized to connect to server

Java.lang.InternalError: can't connect to X11 window server using "xxx" as the 
display value.

You need to run 'xhost +' in the X Server on the machine running CSMART.

Viewing Metrics Results
- Set the Sample Interval to non-zero (but small) to force the
scalability society to take some intermediate samples
- Be sure that on Windows you edited the command-line parameter
specifying the location of Excel
- Results files are not automatically retrieved until you "stop" the society.

Compiling CSMART
- Cougaar now uses asserts, so you should plan to compile with javac.

MySQL Database issues
- If you get SQL errors, claiming that a table does not exist, eg
error: Table 'mycoug.EXPT_EXPERIMENT' doesn't exist
(but which you believe does in fact exist), it may be a case issue - MySQL
is case sensitive on table names. This solution applies to MySQL
databases run on Unix.
The correct version of the tables in the database are ALL LOWERCASE.
To get all queries automatically converted to lowercase, you should
set the following MySQL server parameter:
lower_case_table_names.

On Windows, this variable is defaulted to 1, on Unix, it is defaulted to 0.
When set to 1, all table names are set to lower case on load and store.
To solve the Unix case problem, create a file /etc/my.cnf and add:
[mysqld]
set-variable   =   lower_case_table_names=1

Then restart your server.
Note that if you have already loaded data into your Unix MySQL
database, the table names may be uppercase in some instances. This
will cause problems - you will need to reload your database, after
setting the above parameter.

- If on loading a society from the database into CSMART you see errors
  like: 16:12:17,228 ERROR [DBUtils] - dbExecute: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
tmp_alib_component_"
"SMALL_1AD_TRANS_STU_ST1359  AS SELECT DISTINCT GO.ORG_ID AS
....

this probably indicates a corrupted database due to
carriage-return/newline issues on loading the CSMART configuration
database. Try editing the file and removing excess ^Ms. See bug# 1321.
