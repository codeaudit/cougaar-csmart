Here are some tips for solving some common problems. In general, you
should make sure that you can run minitestconfig, and view the data
from a PSP, before worrying about CSMART specific items. If your
problem is not addressed here, send a query to
cougaar-developers@cougaar.org.

Running the Server
- Ensure that the Classpath for the Server, and as defined in your server
properties file, and for CSMART itself, include the same copies of
server.jar, csmart.jar, etc.
- Ensure that you edit the Server startup script to point to your
installation specific server properties file.
- Be sure that your versions of server.jar, core.jar, and csmart.jar
are all from the same build (this results in RMI exceptions
occasionally).

Running the Society Monitor Standalone
- Ensure that the grappa, JCChart, planserver, and csmart jars are all
in the classpath for the Society Monitor
- Ensure that you have included all of the CSMART PSPs from
csmart/data/common/default.psps.xml in whichever set of PSPs you are
loading
- If you are trying to use the standard CSMART default.psps.xml, be
sure that you have set org.cougaar.config.path to include
COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/csmart/data/common/, and have included this
_before_ any other directory that contains a default.psps.xml. Be sure
you include "\;" between additions to the config path, and at the end
of your command-line additions.

Running one of the supplied pre-configured Societies
- If you see an error about the Mylib library when running SingleCluster, this
indicates that the metrics Plugins could not find the named library,
available in csmart-3rdparty.zip. If on a Windows or Linux i386 machine, be sure
this libary is in a directory on your path. Otherwise, you may safely
ignore this error.

Running CSMART
- Ensure that csmart, planserver, server, grappa, jcchart, xerces,
glm, and core jar files are all included
- Ensure that all jar files are from the same build


Configuring a Scalability Society
- Be sure you have at least one Leaf Allocator in your last level.
- There is always one agent in the first level.
- There should be at least one Org Allocator in each of the middle levels.


Configuring an ABC Society
- You must have at least one community, and at least as many levels as
communities


Configuring an External ABC Impact
- To include an impact in an experiment, remember to drag it into the
Experiment in the Experiment Builder.
- Be sure your XML file includes the DTD, as in the examples in
csmart/data/rwe-scripts
- For Cyber Attacks, the _full_ agent name must be specified, as it is
generated by the CSMART Configuration Builder. Otherwise, your impacts
will not be transduced into InfrastructureEvents.
- Kinetic Events will only work once Organizations and Entities
support having geographic locations.

Starting a Society from the Experiment Controller
- Ensure you've followed all the tips on running the Server above
- If the configuration files are being written out, try running the various Nodes by hand
from the command line
- Be sure that the name of the host you've asked a Node to be started
on is either an IP address or the fully-qualified host name
- Be sure that you can resolve the host name into an IP address
- If running Nodes on more than one machine, try running
minitestconfig split among those machines, and ensure that that works

Viewing Metrics Results
- The Scalability society may not write any metrics until it has
completed running.
- Set the Sample Interval to non-zero (but small) to force the
scalability society to take some intermediate samples
- Be sure that on Windows you editted the command-line parameter
specifying the location of Excel
