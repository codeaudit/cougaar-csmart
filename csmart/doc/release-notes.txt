CSMART Release Notes

Release v8.6.0, Cougaar v8.6.0:
CSMART is now the preferred means for running large Cougaar
societies. Beginning with this release, CSMART version numbers track
Cougaar version numbers. See the new more complete installation instructions.

- Added support for configuring and running societies from a
  configuration database.

- Added a configuration database which defines several complex Cougaar
societies.

- Fixed Impacts so that all parameters are controlled from the
configurable component.

- Added more metrics to Basic Metric

- Added ability to search / monitor Node console output streams

- Added complex find function in Society Monitor Plan View

Release v0.4.1, Cougaar v8.4.1:
- Numerous bug fixes

- Add support for displaying LocationSchedule information in Agent view

- Initial support for format-independent initialization data generation:
preparing to convert to a purely database-driving society
configuration.

- Agent view uses arrows between agents to indicate relationships.

- Separate impacts and metrics into separate components that are
separately added to societies.

- Support search in Node STDOUT panes in console, including ctrl-s
(search) and ctrl-t (find again) support

- Limited support for experiments whose parameters vary the number of
agents - new unassigned agents are assigned arbitrarily to existing
Nodes.

- Complete support for ABC impacts on message transport


Release v0.4, Cougaar v8.4:
- This release adds support for experiments with multiple trials. Set
a property to <empty> in the ConfigurationBuilder, and you can vary it
in the ExperimentBuilder. See the online help for details.

- The Community View now works in the Society Monitor. However, it is
only interesting for societies the include the CommunityPG on their
Entities (like the ABC Society).

- This release also includes preliminary support for configuring
  arbitrary Cougaar components, and mixing and matching components
  among societies.
  
- This release includes multiple bug fixes and smaller enhancements.

- Beginning with this release, CSMART is included with the standard
  Cougaar release, and no longer as a separate module.
  
- The CSMART required jar file: grappa1_2.jar has been
  replaced. Instead, use the Cougaar 3rd party jar file:
  grappa1_2_bbn.jar

- Old & new CSMART users should see the CSMART-Install document for
  new, simplified installation instructions.
