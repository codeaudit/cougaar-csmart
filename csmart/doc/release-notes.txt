CSMART Release Notes

Release 9.2.2:
- Solved bug 1304 & related 1279. Note that now that this is solved, we 
  have reverted the default for doWorkspace! By default, the workspace
  is no re-enabled. As before, the startup scripts indicate how to
  disable this.
- Added support for specifying component load priority (bug 1310).
- Added new Topology view in Society Monitor for viewing mobile Agents.
- Fixed bug 1323 (no prompt to name recipes)
- Add icons for recipes, societies, and experiments in Organizer!
- Unique names are now created with a number in square-brackets, not
  just by appending a number.
- Fix some bugs with Property iterators, etc.
- Fix bugs allowing user to make edits during a save (bugs 1339,1078)
- Mostly fixed export scripts (bug 1231)
- Better error messages on failure to reach servlets (bug 1302)
- Fix bug in modification recognition (bug 1335)

Release 9.2.1:
- Multiple bug fixes
- Note that changes to the default AppServer properties file to use
the Java "server" VM on some Nodes may require Path changes on some systems, when
you upgrade your AppServer properties file. See the Install
instructions (./InstallAndTest.html) for details.
- Add Community tables to CSMART DB to begin support for Community configuration
- Performance improvements (bug 1226)
- Allow running Nodes without any Agents (bug 1265)
- Address errors using Agent Insertion Recipes (bugs 1240, 1245)
- Add Dos DB dump scripts (bug 1229)
- Address servlet errors with GLS Init window (bug 1215) and Society
Monitor (bug 1241)
- New option to not read or write a Workspace file: Add the CSMART -D
argument org.cougaar.tools.csmart.doWorkspace=false to use this. Note
that this means you will have to re-load your Experiments and recipes
from the database every time you restart CSMART.
- Allow specifying $HOST in Node command line arguments to indicate
the name of the machine on which the Node will be running (bug 861)
- Address errors in enabling tools (bug 1268)
- Address errors auto-running societies (bug 1269)
- Address errors with non-unique folder names (bug 1267)
- Remove obsolete Heartbeat in console (bug 1247)
- Avoid double-counted warnings on recipe change (bug 1107)
- Disconnect GLS UI when society stops to avoid warning (bug 1055)
- Ensure possible to use Analyzer to view old Experiment results
- Use lower-case database table names throughout
- Remove unused database tables (bug 1225)
- Known issues: There are some rare NPEs (bugs 1304, 1279). To avoid
these, try setting the doWorkspace flag to false (see above). Some
elements of experiments are not copied - like Node descriptions, etc
(bug 1076). We have seen intermittent Swing exceptions while running a
society (bug 1104). Finally, command-line scripts to export/copy experiments &
recipes do not work (bugs 1231, 950).

Release 9.2:
- New ability to load societies from INI files
- New UIs to edit societies within CSMART
- Infrastructure support for recipes that do removal / modifications
- New ability to create a society from the recipe/society combination in an experiment
- Configuration database cleanup, and load process changes (see
InstallAndTest.html)
- Fixes to improve accuracy of debug output INI files
- Fix support for adding Node Binders with recipes
- Add support for adding plugins, binders to Node Agents via recipes
(try a SpecificInsertionRecipe where the target query specifies _Nodes_!)
- Add support for adding arbitrary components to agents
- Move to JDK1.4
- Bug fixes
- Known issue: CSMART is slow - multiple minutes to load & start a Full-1AD
  society. Improvements for this will be added for a 9.2.1 patch
  release in mid-May. See bug # 1226
- Known issue: Society Monitor fails to contact all Agents. You get an error
  message listing the agents it fails to contact. This includes every
  Node Agent, but also Agents that have working CSMART servlets.
  See bug # 1241
- Known issue: Copying an Agent Insertion Recipe causes NPE. See bug # 1240
- Known issue: If you hit "Connect" in the GLS Init Window in the console
  too early, the servlet will not update after you publish the OPLAN. To
  get around this, wait until the society has quiesced before hitting the
  Connect button. If you have already done so, use the stand-alone
  GLS UI in CIP/bin/GLSInit.[bat/sh]  See bug# 1215
- Known issue: Experiment and recipe export scripts may no longer work. 
  As a workaround, try using the complete DB export scripts in
  csmart/data/database/scripts/mysql/dump_1ad_mysql.sh  See bug # 1231 (and 1229)

Release 9.0:
- The CSMART required Cougaar 3rd party jar file: grappa1_2_bbn.jar has been changed 
  to grappa1_2.jar. The BBN modifications in the prior jar are now included in the 
  standard Grappa jar.
- Repackage and code cleanup for readability
- Use Servlets instead of PSPs. You must now explicitly add
a PSP to your society, including adding the PlanServerPlugin, if you
really want to run a PSP.
- Remove use of ConfigurationWriter in talking to the AppServer
- New ServletGroupInsertion recipe for inserting sets of servlets
- Default inclusion of basic servlets with built-in experiments
- Use new Cougaar Logging Service
- New Servlet based GLS / Oplan UI within console
- Updated build script to Ant1.4.1
- New File menu items for easy access
- Basic version information written to log file, available from Help menu
- Disabled built-in societies, pending full database support
- Due to above, experiments with multiple trials are temporarily
disabled
- Results (metrics & log files) directory now defaults to CIP/results,
and is set from a global file menu, not on a per-experiment basis

Release v8.8.0
This release represents all of the fixes made during integration on
the 8.6.2 release

Release v8.6.2, Cougaar v8.6.2:
A patch release, with multiple usability improvements. Emphasis
is on supporting much larger societies, the 1AD society in particular,
running off of MySQL databases.
- Upgrade DB to use 1AD society

- Metrics and Impacts merged into general purpose concept: Recipes.
Use Recipes to define steps to take to modify an experiment. Recipes
typically add a plugin, binder, or agent to one or more spots in a 
society.

- MySQL Thread selection now supported

- Class 9 Threads now work

- Store hosts, nodes with experiment. Permit deleting hosts from experiment

- Save all host, node attributes in database

- Support setting non -D arguments, global -D arguments on Nodes (with
  defaults provided), showing these in Node info screen on console, and possibly 
  loading a set of values from a file

- Support a delay between Node launches, default to 0

- Sort hosts, nodes, and support find operations

- Allow user to force edit of a previously run experiment, or recipe

- Better support for data validation in Config Builder

- Add ability to individually kill & restart Nodes

- Support plan view filtering by agent

- Add tab in ExperimentBuilder to show selected threads & groups

- New debug function to write out old style configuration files

- Simple database export and manipulation scripts added


Release v8.6.0, Cougaar v8.6.0:
CSMART is now the preferred means for running large Cougaar
societies. Beginning with this release, CSMART version numbers track
Cougaar version numbers. See the new more complete installation instructions.

- Added support for configuring and running societies from a
  configuration database.

- Added a configuration database which defines several complex Cougaar
societies.

- Fixed Impacts so that all parameters are controlled from the
configurable component.

- Added more metrics to Basic Metric

- Added ability to search / monitor Node console output streams

- Added complex find function in Society Monitor Plan View

Release v0.4.1, Cougaar v8.4.1:
- Numerous bug fixes

- Add support for displaying LocationSchedule information in Agent view

- Initial support for format-independent initialization data generation:
preparing to convert to a purely database-driving society
configuration.

- Agent view uses arrows between agents to indicate relationships.

- Separate impacts and metrics into separate components that are
separately added to societies.

- Support search in Node STDOUT panes in console, including ctrl-s
(search) and ctrl-t (find again) support

- Limited support for experiments whose parameters vary the number of
agents - new unassigned agents are assigned arbitrarily to existing
Nodes.

- Complete support for ABC impacts on message transport


Release v0.4, Cougaar v8.4:
- This release adds support for experiments with multiple trials. Set
a property to <empty> in the ConfigurationBuilder, and you can vary it
in the ExperimentBuilder. See the online help for details.

- The Community View now works in the Society Monitor. However, it is
only interesting for societies the include the CommunityPG on their
Entities (like the ABC Society).

- This release also includes preliminary support for configuring
  arbitrary Cougaar components, and mixing and matching components
  among societies.
  
- This release includes multiple bug fixes and smaller enhancements.

- Beginning with this release, CSMART is included with the standard
  Cougaar release, and no longer as a separate module.
  
- The CSMART required jar file: grappa1_2.jar has been
  replaced. Instead, use the Cougaar 3rd party jar file:
  grappa1_2_bbn.jar

- Old & new CSMART users should see the CSMART-Install document for
  new, simplified installation instructions.
