CSMART Release Notes

Release v0.4, Cougaar v8.4:
This release adds support for experiments with multiple trials. Set a property to <empty> in the ConfigurationBuilder, and you can vary it in the ExperimentBuilder. See the online help for details.

The Community View now works in the Society Monitor. However, it is only interesting for societies the include the CommunityPG on their Entities (like the ABC Society).

This release also includes preliminary support for configuring arbitrary Cougaar components, and mixing and 
matching components among societies.

This release includes multiple bug fixes and smaller enhancements.

Beginning with this release, CSMART is included with the standard Cougaar release, and no longer as a separate module. 

The CSMART required jar file: grappa1_2.jar has been replaced. Instead, use the Cougaar 3rd party jar file: grappa1_2_bbn.jar

Old & new CSMART users should see the CSMART-Install document for new, simplified installation instructions.
