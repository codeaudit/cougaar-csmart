CSMART Release Notes

Release 9.0:
- The CSMART required Cougaar 3rd party jar file: grappa1_2_bbn.jar has been changed 
  to grappa1_2.jar. The BBN modifications in the prior jar are now included in the 
  standard Grappa jar.
- Repackage and code cleanup for readability
- Use Servlets instead of PSPs. You must now explicitly add
a PSP to your society, including adding the PlanServerPlugin, if you
really want to run a PSP.
- Remove use of ConfigurationWriter in talking to the AppServer
- New ServletGroupInsertion recipe for inserting sets of servlets
- Default inclusion of basic servlets with built-in experiments
- Use new Cougaar Logging Service
- New Servlet based GLS / Oplan UI within console
- Updated build script to Ant1.4.1
- New File menu items for easy access
- Basic version information written to log file, available from Help menu
- Disabled built-in societies, pending full database support
- Due to above, experiments with multiple trials are temporarily
disabled
- Results (metrics & log files) directory now defaults to CIP/results,
and is set from a global file menu, not on a per-experiment basis

Release v8.8.0
This release represents all of the fixes made during integration on
the 8.6.2 release

Release v8.6.2, Cougaar v8.6.2:
A patch release, with multiple usability improvements. Emphasis
is on supporting much larger societies, the 1AD society in particular,
running off of MySQL databases.
- Upgrade DB to use 1AD society

- Metrics and Impacts merged into general purpose concept: Recipes.
Use Recipes to define steps to take to modify an experiment. Recipes
typically add a plugin, binder, or agent to one or more spots in a 
society.

- MySQL Thread selection now supported

- Class 9 Threads now work

- Store hosts, nodes with experiment. Permit deleting hosts from experiment

- Save all host, node attributes in database

- Support setting non -D arguments, global -D arguments on Nodes (with
  defaults provided), showing these in Node info screen on console, and possibly 
  loading a set of values from a file

- Support a delay between Node launches, default to 0

- Sort hosts, nodes, and support find operations

- Allow user to force edit of a previously run experiment, or recipe

- Better support for data validation in Config Builder

- Add ability to individually kill & restart Nodes

- Support plan view filtering by agent

- Add tab in ExperimentBuilder to show selected threads & groups

- New debug function to write out old style configuration files

- Simple database export and manipulation scripts added


Release v8.6.0, Cougaar v8.6.0:
CSMART is now the preferred means for running large Cougaar
societies. Beginning with this release, CSMART version numbers track
Cougaar version numbers. See the new more complete installation instructions.

- Added support for configuring and running societies from a
  configuration database.

- Added a configuration database which defines several complex Cougaar
societies.

- Fixed Impacts so that all parameters are controlled from the
configurable component.

- Added more metrics to Basic Metric

- Added ability to search / monitor Node console output streams

- Added complex find function in Society Monitor Plan View

Release v0.4.1, Cougaar v8.4.1:
- Numerous bug fixes

- Add support for displaying LocationSchedule information in Agent view

- Initial support for format-independent initialization data generation:
preparing to convert to a purely database-driving society
configuration.

- Agent view uses arrows between agents to indicate relationships.

- Separate impacts and metrics into separate components that are
separately added to societies.

- Support search in Node STDOUT panes in console, including ctrl-s
(search) and ctrl-t (find again) support

- Limited support for experiments whose parameters vary the number of
agents - new unassigned agents are assigned arbitrarily to existing
Nodes.

- Complete support for ABC impacts on message transport


Release v0.4, Cougaar v8.4:
- This release adds support for experiments with multiple trials. Set
a property to <empty> in the ConfigurationBuilder, and you can vary it
in the ExperimentBuilder. See the online help for details.

- The Community View now works in the Society Monitor. However, it is
only interesting for societies the include the CommunityPG on their
Entities (like the ABC Society).

- This release also includes preliminary support for configuring
  arbitrary Cougaar components, and mixing and matching components
  among societies.
  
- This release includes multiple bug fixes and smaller enhancements.

- Beginning with this release, CSMART is included with the standard
  Cougaar release, and no longer as a separate module.
  
- The CSMART required jar file: grappa1_2.jar has been
  replaced. Instead, use the Cougaar 3rd party jar file:
  grappa1_2_bbn.jar

- Old & new CSMART users should see the CSMART-Install document for
  new, simplified installation instructions.
