csmart/doc/CSMART-Install.txt

These instructions for installing CSMART assume some familiarity with
Cougaar and how to install Cougaar.

A standard installation will begin from the following files:
1) csmart.zip -- a Cougaar module to be installed within your Cougaar
   installation directory.
   Contains startup scripts, data files, and built CSMART code.
   Unzip in your Cougaar install directory.
2) csmart-3rdparty.zip -- Third party components required for
   CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar install directory.  Jar files may
   already be present for base Cougaar. Executables may need to be
   renamed on Unix systems. See below for details.
3) csmart-api.zip -- Javadocs for CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar
   install directory.
4) csmart-dev.zip -- Source code for CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar
   installation directory.



Dependencies:
Cougaar required version of JDK -- 1.3
Latest Cougaar - 8.3 
      core, planserver, contract, server, scalability, and glm modules
      Note: If you experience RMI Exceptions running Nodes from the
      CSMART Console, be sure you are using the official 8.3 release,
      or else re-build csmart.jar using your current Cougaar release.
Latest Cougaar required versions of jcchart (451) and xerces
grappa1_2_bbn.jar -
    AT&T GraphViz Grappa package version 1.2 for graph rendering,
    including some BBN modifications for performance
    enhancements. Available in the csamrt-3rdparty.zip file. See the
    GraphViz site for more information.
  
dot.exe:
    AT&T GraphViz from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
    or http://ABCTestbed.bbn.com.
    Also available in the csmart-3rdparty.zip file

Optional: JUnit, Jikes and Ant

Some notes:
-- CSMART adds some required run-time properties - so has a separate
setarguments.bat
-- CSMART requires the GLM domain, plus its own CSMART domain (and hence
has its own LDMDomains.ini)
-- CSMART adds a number of PSPs - listed and documented in
data/common/default.psps.xml
-- CSMART relies on COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH, PATH, etc.
-- Included scripts expect that the csmart module will be installed as a
sub-directory of COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH


Installation Instructions:
To set up your environment to run CSMART (note: this must be done on
every machine where you want to run a Cougaar node from CSMART):
0) JDK1.3 is required.  (Ensure a good installation of JUnit and ANT
   and Jikes if you wish to use those.)
1) Install 8.3 version of Cougaar as usual
-- Install core, contract, planserver, glm, server and other modules
-- Set the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH (CIP)
-- Put CIP/bin on your PATH, - followed immediately by CIP/csmart/bin!!
2) Install CSMART Cougaar module as a sub-directory to CIP (by unzipping
csmart.zip into CIP or from CVS)
3) Install third party tools, by unzipping csmart-3rdparty.zip in CIP.
-- dot.exe and dot-L386 go in CIP/csmart/bin. On Unix machines, rename
   dot-L386 to dot.exe
-- AT&T GraphViz jar with BBN mods, grappa1_2_bbn.jar goes in CIP/sys
-- Standard Cougaar 3rd party jars xerces.jar and jcchart451K.jar go in
   CIP/sys
Note that the included Society Monitor startup scripts require the use
   of CIP/sys for these third party jar files.
All other required Cougaar jar files should already be present,
   including core, glm, planserver, server, scalability, and contract
-- Mylib.dll (Win machines) / libmylib.so (i386 Linux) shared library
   should go in your path (like CIP/csmart/bin - which must be on your
   path, per Step 1, above), or in the appropriate library loading
   directory for the JRE: jre/bin on Win platforms, jre/lib/i386 on Linux
   i386 systems. This library measures CPU load for metrics collection,
   and is not required.
4)  Modify the Node startup scripts: CSMART has its own required
   arguments, and some additional jar file.
       (For CSMART there are several additional properties to include.
    Additionally, we want to ensure the COUGAAR_DEV_PATH is searched
    for developers.  Finally, we want to set org.cougaar.config.path,
    in particular to ensure that csmart/data/common is available for
    its LDMDomains.ini)

    The scripts CIP/bin/setlibpath.bat, CIP/bin/setarguments.bat
and CIP/bin/Node will need to be modified to include the necessary
parameters (CIP/bin/Node.bat does not need to be modified, and
setlibpath.bat is modified just for cleanliness). There are sample
scripts in csmart/bin with the details, named: CSMARTNode,
CSMARTsetlibpath.bat, and CSMARTsetarguments.bat. Use these as
examples. Novice Cougaar developers should replace the existing files
in CIP/bin with those included in csmart/bin (changing the file names
by removing the "CSMART" prefix).

5) Edit CIP/bin/setarguments.bat or Node (the new ones) to set your
   logging level and config path, as you prefer. Also set the location
   of Excel in CSMART.bat

At this point, as a simple test, you should be able to run any of the
pre-built Nodes included in csmart/data. Run these as you would any
Cougaar Node: From the appropriate configuration directory, type: Node
<NodeName: SingleCluster, TwoCluster, ThreeCluster, etc>
You should be able to view the contents of the Blackboard for these
Societies, using the CSMART Society Monitor in its stand-alone form
(use the provided Monitor scripts in csmart/bin).
If you have problems, see the trouble-shooting section.
   
6) Configure site-specific server properties files. There are samples
   included in csmart/data which set properties required to run
   CSMART. Edit the included csmart/bin/Server scripts to point to your
   site-specific Server properties file and the location of that file on
   your system.
      -- Note that the server must have the csmart.jar file on its LIBPATHS

At this point, all required steps to run CSMART are complete.
Test your server installation first: Run the server, using one of the
supplied Server startup scripts. You should see some progress lines to
STDOUT, followed by "Server Running".

Then, you may start CSMART, using one of the supplied CSMART scripts
in csmart/bin. See the CSMART user's documentation for running
instructions.

If you have problems, see the trouble-shooting guide.

For developers:
7) Optional: Install csmart source (csmart-dev.zip) and javadocs
   (csmart-api.zip)
8) If you have the source and want to develop it, set COUGAAR_DEV_PATH
   to CIP/csmart/tmpdir
