csmart/doc/CSMART-Install.txt

These instructions for installing CSMART assume some familiarity with
Cougaar and how to install Cougaar.

A standard installation will begin from the following files:
1) cougaar.zip - Standard Cougaar build. This will supply you with the
   CSMART jar file, and CSMART scripts and binaries, docs, and data files. Unzip
   into your Cougaar install path.
2) csmart-dev.zip -- Source code and Java docs for CSMART. Unzip in
   your Cougaar install path.
3) cougaar-support.zip -- Third party jar files and binaries. Includes
   some CSMART specific required Jars (grappa).

(An equivalent, v0.3 install would include, on top of a normal Cougaar
install:
1) csmart.zip -- a Cougaar module to be installed within your Cougaar
   installation directory.
   Contains startup scripts, data files, and built CSMART code.
   Unzip in your Cougaar install directory.
2) csmart-3rdparty.zip -- Third party components required for
   CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar install directory.  Jar files may
   already be present for base Cougaar. See below for details.
3) csmart-api.zip -- Javadocs for CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar
   install directory.
4) csmart-dev.zip -- Source code for CSMART. Unzip in your Cougaar
   installation directory.)


Dependencies:
Cougaar required version of JDK -- 1.3
Latest Cougaar - 8.3 
      core, planserver, contract, server, scalability, and glm modules
      Note: If you experience RMI Exceptions running Nodes from the
      CSMART Console, be sure you are using the official 8.3 release,
      or else re-build csmart.jar using your current Cougaar release.
Latest Cougaar required versions of jcchart (451) and xerces
grappa1_2_bbn.jar -
    AT&T GraphViz Grappa package version 1.2 for graph rendering,
    including some BBN modifications for performance
    enhancements. Available in the csmart-3rdparty.zip or
    cougaar-support.zip files. See the GraphViz site for more
    information.
  
dot.exe:
    AT&T GraphViz from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
    or http://ABCTestbed.bbn.com.
    Also available in the csmart-3rdparty.zip and cougaar.zip files

Optional: JUnit, Jikes and Ant(1.3 or better)

Some notes:
-- CSMART adds some required run-time properties - so has a separate
setarguments.bat
-- CSMART requires the GLM domain, plus its own CSMART domain (and hence
has its own LDMDomains.ini)
-- CSMART adds a number of PSPs - listed and documented in
data/common/default.psps.xml
-- CSMART relies on COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH, PATH, etc.
-- Included scripts expect that the csmart module will be installed as a
sub-directory of COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH


Installation Instructions:
To set up your environment to run CSMART (note: this must be done on
every machine where you want to run a Cougaar node from CSMART):
0) JDK1.3 is required.  (Ensure a good installation of JUnit and ANT
   and Jikes if you wish to use those.)
1) Install 8.3 version of Cougaar as usual
-- Install core, contract, planserver, glm, server and other modules
----- If installing from a normal complete Cougaar install, this also
gives you CSMART! It supplies CIP/lib/csmart.jar and CIP/csmart module
with scripts, binaries, data files, and documents!
-- This normal install gives you CIP/scalability/bin with 2 shared
  libraries. Follow the contained Install instructions, and put the
  appropriate library on your PATH.
-- Set the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH (CIP)
-- Put CIP/bin on your PATH, - followed immediately by
CIP/csmart/bin!!
-- Install Cougaar support libraries (often from cougaar-support.zip,
by unzipping in CIP).
---- For CSMART, this must include xerces.jar, jcchart451K.jar, and
   grappa1_2_bbn.jar all installed in CIP/sys

Most installers can now jump to step 4. However, if for some reason
you did not get a complete Cougaar install that included CSMART, the
following 2 steps are also required:
2) Install CSMART Cougaar module as a sub-directory to CIP (by
   unzipping csmart.zip into CIP or from CVS, or by re-extracting the
   csmart jar file and csmart sub-directory from the main Cougaar
   build)

3) Install third party tools, by unzipping csmart-3rdparty.zip or
   cougaar-support.zip in CIP (may already be done).
-- AT&T GraphViz jar with BBN mods, grappa1_2_bbn.jar goes in CIP/sys
-- Standard Cougaar 3rd party jars xerces.jar and jcchart451K.jar go in
   CIP/sys
-- From 3rd party zip or cougaar.zip: dot.exe and dot-l386 go in
   CIP/csmart/bin or CIP/sys.

Note that the included Society Monitor startup scripts require the use
   of CIP/sys for these third party jar files.
All other required Cougaar jar files should already be present,
   including core, glm, planserver, server, scalability, and contract
-- csmart-3rdparty.zip also includes 2 shared libraries, which you may
already have if you installed Cougaar from a cougaar.zip, in the
scalability/bin directory:
   Mylib.dll (Win machines) / libmylib.so (i386 Linux) shared library
   should go in your path (like CIP/csmart/bin - which must be on your
   path, per Step 1, above), or in the appropriate library loading
   directory for the JRE: jre/bin on Win platforms, jre/lib/i386 on Linux
   i386 systems. This library measures CPU load for metrics collection,
   and is not required.


Most installers can continue here:      
4)  Modify the Node startup scripts: CSMART has its own required
   arguments, and some additional jar file.
       (For CSMART there are several additional properties to include.
    Additionally, we want to ensure the COUGAAR_DEV_PATH is searched
    for developers.  Finally, we want to set org.cougaar.config.path,
    in particular to ensure that csmart/data/common is available for
    its LDMDomains.ini)

    The scripts CIP/bin/setlibpath.bat, CIP/bin/setarguments.bat
and CIP/bin/Node will need to be modified to include the necessary
parameters (CIP/bin/Node.bat does not need to be modified, and
setlibpath.bat is modified just for cleanliness). There are sample
scripts in csmart/bin with the details, named: CSMARTNode,
CSMARTsetlibpath.bat, and CSMARTsetarguments.bat. Use these as
examples. Novice Cougaar developers should replace the existing files
in CIP/bin with those included in csmart/bin (changing the file names
by removing the "CSMART" prefix).

5) Edit CIP/bin/setarguments.bat or Node (the new ones) to set your
   logging level and config path, as you prefer. Also set the location
   of Excel in CSMART.bat

At this point, as a simple test, you should be able to run any of the
pre-built Nodes included in csmart/data. Run these as you would any
Cougaar Node: From the appropriate configuration directory, type: Node
<NodeName: SingleCluster, TwoCluster, ThreeCluster, etc>
You should be able to view the contents of the Blackboard for these
Societies, using the CSMART Society Monitor in its stand-alone form
(use the provided Monitor scripts in csmart/bin).
If you have problems, see the trouble-shooting section.
   
6) Configure site-specific server properties files. There are samples
   included in csmart/data which set properties required to run
   CSMART. Edit the included csmart/bin/Server scripts to point to your
   site-specific Server properties file and the location of that file on
   your system.
      -- Note that the server must have the csmart.jar file on its LIBPATHS

At this point, all required steps to run CSMART are complete.
Test your server installation first: Run the server, using one of the
supplied Server startup scripts. You should see some progress lines to
STDOUT, followed by "Server Running".

Then, you may start CSMART, using one of the supplied CSMART scripts
in csmart/bin. See the CSMART user's documentation for running
instructions.

If you have problems, see the trouble-shooting guide.

For developers:
7) Optional: Install csmart source and javadocs (csmart-dev.zip)
   (javadocs available in old form in csmart-api.zip)
8) If you have the source and want to develop it, set COUGAAR_DEV_PATH
   to CIP/csmart/tmpdir
