CSMART contains a few known issues:

* If the area under the menu is not being refreshed in the CSMART 
  Performance Analyzer tool after the File-Open menu item is invoked, 
  then you need to update your version of Java to jdk1.3.1_01 
  (see http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4189244.html).

* In configurable components, the Societies Task Verb currently does nothing.
  The purpose is for a future feature that will centralize input of all
  new tasks.  Currently, you must type the Verb everywhere it is required. 

* If the area under the menu is not being refreshed in the CSMART
  Performance Analyzer tool after the File-Open menu item is invoked,
  then you need to update your version of Java to jdk1.3.1_01 (see
  http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4189244.html).

* Impacts currently cannot be used with a Database society.

* CMT Societies cannot be configured with a MySQL database.

* An experiment removed from the database may still show up in your
  CSMART workspace.

* Copying experiments in certain circumstances results in lost Agents.
