CSMART contains a few known issues:

* Society Monitor will warn about an inability to contact Agents in
  which no CSMART Servlets are running. This will usually include all
  Node Agents. While not a bug, it is annoying. See bug # 1241

* Experiment and recipe export scripts may no longer work. 
  As a workaround, try using the complete DB export scripts in
  csmart/data/database/scripts/mysql/dump_1ad_mysql.sh  See bug # 1231 

* An experiment removed from the database may still show up in your
  CSMART workspace.

* Running a node on a multiprocessor machines may result in the CSMART
  console freezing up.

* There are a couple NPEs that can occur but we have not been able to
  reproduce. If you see an error message mentioning a bug #, please
  report on Bugzilla what you saw.

* Some Windows 2000 users corrupted data loading the CSMART
  database. This has not been reproduced.

* MySQL cannot load data across network drives, causing errors
  creating the database in some circumstances. See bug# 1257.
