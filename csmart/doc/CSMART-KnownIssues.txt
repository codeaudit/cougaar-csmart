CSMART contains a few known issues:

* Society Monitor will warn about an inability to contact Agents in
  which no CSMART Servlets are running. This will usually include all
  Node Agents. While not a bug, it is annoying. See bug # 1241

* An experiment removed from the database may still show up in your
  CSMART workspace.

* Running a node on a multiprocessor machines may result in the CSMART
  console freezing up.

* We have seen occasional Swing exceptions while running an Experiment
  in the console. This is being reported to Sun. See bug #1104.

* Windows users creating societies from new-style INI files must put
  the directory containing those files on the org.cougaar.config.path
  for CSMART.

* Some Windows users report corrupted data loading the CSMART
  database when getting data files from CVS or after editing the
  files. If you need to edit the DB or get your CSMART db data files
  from CVS, try using Cygwin. See bug #1321.

* MySQL cannot load data across network drives, causing errors
  creating the database in some circumstances. See bug# 1257.
