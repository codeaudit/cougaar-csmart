CSMART contains a few known issues:

* CSMART is slow - multiple minutes to load & start a Full-1AD
  society. Improvements for this will be added for a 9.2.1 patch
  release in mid-May. See bug # 1226

* Society Monitor fails to contact all Agents. You get an error
  message listing the agents it fails to contact. This includes every
  Node Agent, but also Agents that have working CSMART servlets.
  See bug # 1241

* Copying an Agent Insertion Recipe causes NPE. See bug # 1240

* If you hit "Connect" in the GLS Init Window in the console
  too early, the servlet will not update after you publish the OPLAN. To
  get around this, wait until the society has quiesced before hitting the
  Connect button. If you have already done so, use the stand-alone
  GLS UI in CIP/bin/GLSInit.[bat/sh]  See bug# 1215

* Experiment and recipe export scripts may no longer work. 
  As a workaround, try using the complete DB export scripts in
  csmart/data/database/scripts/mysql/dump_1ad_mysql.sh  See bug # 1231 

* Database dump scripts not available as BAT scripts. Bug 1229

* An experiment removed from the database may still show up in your
  CSMART workspace.

* Selecting groups in the Thread/Group view does not work

* Some relationship arrows in the Agent View erroneously point 2 ways

* Running a node on a multiprocessor machines may result in the CSMART
  console freezing up
