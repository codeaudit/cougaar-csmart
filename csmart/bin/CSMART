# Main script to run CSMART on Unix
# Note that CSMART writes some files to its working directory.
    
# Next section lists Jar files required for CSMART. Note that by default CSMART uses the Cougaar
# Bootstrapper, which should find the jar files automatically (searching CIP/lib, plugins, sys, etc).
# One need only include the core jar file

# COUGAAR bootstrapping classpath will be:
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib/core.jar
#
# once running, jar files will be searched for in (in order):
#  -Dorg.cougaar.class.path 	like classpath
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib/*
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/plugins/*
#  -Dorg.cougaar.system.path=$COUGAAR3RDPARTY
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/sys/*
#  $CLASSPATH		(Cougaar bootstrapping path from above)
#
