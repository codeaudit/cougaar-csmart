<h2>Configuration Builder</h2>
Use this tool to configure a Society or Recipe.
Societies can be modified by adding or deleting agents, binders, and other components, and by adding or deleting agent property groups and relationships.  In addition,
parameters of agents, binders, components, property groups, and relationships can be added, deleted, and modified.
Recipes can be modified by modifying their parameters, including the agents
they should be applied to and their parameters.
In general, you modify societies when you want to make a few, specific changes,
to specific components and you modify recipes, when you want to make the same
change to multiple components, i.e. to all agents, or all agents that match
a specific pattern.
Use the component specific
help for details on configuring a particular society or recipe. 
<p>Components of the society or recipe are organized in the tree on the left. Properties
of that component can be edited in the tree on the left and in the table on the right. 
<p>In the tree, 
<ul>
<li>use the left mouse button to select a component, and its properties will be
displayed in the table.</li>
<li>use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu with editing actions for the component (usually delete and add).
</ul>
In the table, 
<ul>
<li>hit enter when you are finished editing a value.</li>
<li>hit escape to cancel edits to a particular field in progress.</li>
<li>use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu allowing you to delete a property.</li>
</ul>
Modifications are automatically saved in the
database when you exit the tool.  If a modified society or recipe is contained
in experiments in the workspace, these experiments are displayed in red in order to indicate
that they must be re-saved to the database in order to be updated.  <br>
<br>
<i>Note: Lists are curly-brace enclosed, and comma-separated. Changes to your component are saved automatically in your workspace.</i>
