<h2>Configuration Builder</h2>
Use this tool to configure a Recipe, which can modify the behavior of the Society in an Experiment in various ways (i.e. collect run-time statistics, add
agents, etc.).
In the future, you will be able to specify new Plugins and agents and configure
arbitrary societies. This editor will allow composing and building collections
of components, and importing and exporting sub-collections. This will allow
users to build arbitrary societies.
<p>Components of the society or recipe are organized in the tree on the left. Properties
of that component can be edited in the table on the right. Hit escape to
cancel edits to a particular field in progress. Hit enter when you are
finished editing a value. Modifications are automatically saved in the
database when you exit the tool.  If a recipe is modified, a list of experiments
that use the recipe will be displayed.  These experiments have to be re-saved to the database in order to be updated.  Use the component specific
help for details on configuring a particular society or recipe. <br>
<br>
<i>Note: Lists are curly-brace enclosed, and comma-separated. Changes to your society are saved automatically in your workspace.</i>

<p>
To set up multiple trials in an experiment, delete the values of the properties that you want to vary in the experiment.  The string "not set" will be displayed for those properties.  These properties are "unbound"; specify the values for these properties in an experiment using the Experiment Builder. (This capability is not supported for database experiments.)
