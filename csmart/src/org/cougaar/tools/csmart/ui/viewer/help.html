<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<br>CSMART is a loosely integrated collection of tools for running Cougaar
societies and understanding the results. Currently, CSMART allows building
and running two types of experiments:
<ul>
<li>
experiments based on very regular societies, most suitable for scalability and other such testing, referred to as "built-in" experiments</li>
<li>
experiments based on more elaborate Cougaar societies in which the basic society definition is obtained from a databse, referred to as "database" experiments</li>
</ul>
<h3>CSMART Tool Launcher</h3>
The CSMART Tool Launcher is the primary interface to CSMART, and integrates
the various CSMART tools. From this interface, users create societies,
experiments, and recipes. They then use the various tools to configure,
run, monitor, and analyze Cougaar societies. The CSMART tools are displayed
across the top of this window. These tools are generally used in left-to-right
order. The tools and their functions are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Configuration Builder: </b>Edit society or recipe properties, such as the number
of agents, or parameters for a given Plugin. (Not used for database experiments.)</li>

<li>
<b>Configuration Helper: </b>Ensure that a configuration is consistent.
Not yet available. This may utilize Plugin contracts, etc to help the user
build complete societies.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Builder: </b>Put together the pieces of an Experiment, by
adding a Society to it, and one or more Recipes (including Impacts or Metrics). Use this tool for constructing multiple trials, varying parameters
of your society, or to understand some behavior in more detail. To run a Society,
you must include it in an Experiment. This is also the tool where you assign agents to nodes, and nodes to hosts.
<br>
For database experiments, this tool allows the user to add Recipes (Impacts and Metrics and others) to experiments, and to map agents to nodes, and nodes to hosts.  Multiple trials are not supported in database experiments.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Controller: </b>
Run, stop or abort the experiment, and display output from the experiment.</li>

<li>
<b>Society Monitor: </b>Examine a running society (or saved data from a
previous run), by looking at the contents of its Blackboard. Display graphs
of agents and plan objects, and some simple metrics. This tool may be run
stand-alone for use with non-CSMART Cougaar societies. See the User's Guide.</li>

<li>
<b>Performance Analyzer: </b>Display metric results from an experiment
in progress, or a completed experiment.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Be sure to separately run the Node Server on each host where you want to
run a Node, using one of the supplied Server startup scripts.
<br>To quit CSMART, select File->Exit from the main window, and kill each
of the Servers.<b></b>
<p><b>To run an experiment from the database:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Click the right mouse button on the "Default Workspace" to display a pop-up menu.  Select "New Experiment-From Database" to display a list of experiments defined in the database.  Select the experiment from the database and provide a name for the experiment.</li>
<li>Select the threads and groups for the experiment from the dialog displayed. When you exit the dialog, any modified information is written to the database.</li>
<li>Select the Experiment Builder and assign agents to nodes and nodes to hosts.  When you exit this tool, any modified information is written to the database.</li>
<li>Select the Experiment Controller and select the "Run" button near the top of its window.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To run a tool:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Select the desired experiment or society (possibly creating a new society
or experiment),</li>

<li>
Select a function (edit, run) on the menu on the selected experiment or
society in the Workspace, or</li>

<li>
Select the appropriate toolbar button.</li>
</ul>
<b>To activate a tool:</b> The CSMART tools are activated as follows. Note
that if a folder is selected, then all items in the folder are selected.
Hence, multiple experiments and societies can be selected at once.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Configuration Builder: </b>Always enabled. When the Configuration Builder
tool is selected, a separate Configuration Builder is launched for each
selected society. If no society is selected, a new society is created. (Not used for database experiments.)</li>

<li>
<b>Configuration Helper: </b><i>Not yet available.</i></li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Builder: </b>Always enabled. When the Experiment Builder
tool is selected, a separate Experiment Builder is launched for each selected
experiment. If no experiment is selected, a new one is created.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Controller: </b>Activated if an experiment that contains
a society is selected. Only one Experiment Controller tool is allowed.</li>

<li>
<b>Society Monitor: </b>Activated if an experiment is running. To view
previously saved graphs, or to monitor a non-CSMART Cougaar society, use
this tool in its stand-alone form. See the User's Guide for details.</li>

<li>
<b>Performance Analyzer: </b>Activated if an experiment is selected.</li>
</ul>
CSMART automatically saves your workspace as you go, in the current working
directory. To retrieve previously saved work, Select File-> Open Workspace
from the main CSMART window. Look for the file named according to your
workspace name.<b></b>
<p><b>Workspace</b>
<p>The large lower panel displays the Workspace. The Workspace is used
to create, edit, rename or delete folders, experiments, societies, and recipes. This is how you organize your work. Note that your work is
automatically saved in the current working directory, under the name you
give your workspace. To open a previously saved workspace, use the File
menu option. You may organize items in the workspace however your prefer.
In the future, you will be able to export and import components to facilitate
sharing work.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Select an item: </b>Point to the item and click the left mouse button.
Selecting a folder selects all the items in the folder.</li>

<li>
<b>Create, edit, rename, or delete: </b>Point to the item and click the
right mouse button; select the appropriate action from the pop-up menu
displayed. You may also rename components by clicking on the name directly.</li>

<li>
<b>Arrange items in workspace: </b>Point to the item, hold the left mouse
button and drag the item to a new location.</li>
</ul>
Once you have created an initial society or experiment, use the appropriate
tools to fine tune your component. Then run your experiment using the Experiment
Controller.
<h3>
Societies</h3>
For CSMART purposes, a Society is a collection of Cougaar Agents, grouped
into one or more Communities. Societies are constructed from a template,
and then parametrized to fully specify the desired Communities, Agents,
and Plugins. Currently, two templates are supported for "built-in" societies. Use the Configuration
Builder to tailor a society.  For database experiments, the society is
specified as part of the experiment and cannot be reconfigured with
the Configuration Builder.
<h3>Experiments</h3>
To run a society, it must be included in an Experiment. An Experiment is
made up of one or more trials. Trials are constructed by varying some parameter
- a Plugin parameter, which Agents are run, what Recipes are included,
the distribution of Agents to Nodes or Nodes to Hosts, etc. For each trial,
there may be some results - statistics about the run that are collected
by one of the specified metrics (see below).  Experiments created from
a database already include a society.
<h3>Recipes</h3>
A Recipe is a set of rules for modifying a society, by adding one or
more components to the society. Recipes are meant to be used for
multiple societies.  There are several built-in recipes. By tailoring
these and saving them, users can then retrieve recipes from the
database for later reuse. For example, one recipe might add a certain
plugin to every agent in the society. This Recipe could then be used
for any society.
<br>To create a recipe, select "New Recipe" from the "Default
Workspace" pop-up menu. Then select "Built In" or "From Database". You
will get a list of the available recipes of each type. Once you have
loaded the recipe, you may configure it by selecting "Configure" from
the pop-up menu on the recipe. Be sure to save the recipe when done.
<br>To add a recipe to an Experiment, drag it onto the "Recipes"
folder in the Experiment Builder. Recipes can also be duplicated,
deleted, or renamed by using the pop-up menu.
<h3>
Impacts</h3>
An impact is a kind of recipe, an external effect you wish to impose on a running Cougaar
society. For example, loading the network with background traffic, killing
nodes, telling the system some inventory has been lost, etc. These impacts
might be real (really loading up the network), or simulated (via a Binder
on the MessageTransport or some other mechanism).
<br>CSMART allows the user to specify that certain impacts should be included
in a given experimental run. Currently, the only real impact is the ABC
Impact. 
<br>ABC Impacts are simulated cyber attacks on the cyber resources of the
Cougaar society. 
<br>For details on the ABC Impacts, see the user's guide.
<h3>
Metrics</h3>
A metric is a kind of recipe, a set of run-time statistics about the running society, which
you wish to collect. CSMART allows you to add one or more to your experiment.
Examples might include average and peak CPU utilization, total number of
tasks in the log plan, etc.
<br>Currently, both built-in societies always include a fixed set of
metrics. Database societies do not, and you may add one. The frequency
of sampling however is controlled from within the Society
Configuration tool. See the User's guide for further details.
<h3>
Notes:</h3>

<ul>

<li>
If an appropriate item (experiment or society) is not selected in the Workspace,
then the toolbar button will not be activated.</li>

<li>
Changes to your workspace are saved automatically.</li>
</ul>
