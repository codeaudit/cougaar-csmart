<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<br>CSMART is a loosely integrated collection of tools for configuring and running Cougaar
societies, and understanding the results. For complete details, see
the CSMART User's Guide on the Cougaar web site (<a
href="http://www.cougaar.org">http://www.cougaar.org</a>). CSMART is
used to create a society configuration, store it in a configuration
database, and then run and control that society. For details on
installing CSMART, see the User's Guide, or the included Installation
guide (csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html).<br>

<h3>CSMART Tool Launcher</h3>
The CSMART Tool Launcher is the primary interface to CSMART, and integrates
the various CSMART tools. From this interface, users create societies,
experiments, and recipes. They then use the various tools to configure,
run, monitor, and analyze Cougaar societies. The CSMART tools are displayed
across the top of this window. These tools are generally used in left-to-right
order. The tools and their functions are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Configuration Builder: </b>Edit society or recipe properties, such as the number
of agents, or parameters for a given Plugin.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Builder: </b>Assemble the pieces of an experiment, by
adding one or more recipes to the basic society (including
Metrics). Use this tool to assign agents to nodes, and nodes to hosts,
and set run-time command line arguments for the nodes. This tool also
allows defining communities of agents. </li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Controller: </b>
Run, stop or abort the experiment, and display output from the
experiment. Output from the nodes can be filtered or searched, and
CSMART can notify you of certain Strings in the output. This is often
referred to as the "CSMART Console", for it is the interface for
running Cougaar societies.</li>

<li>
<b>Society Monitor: </b>Examine a running society (or saved data from a
previous run), by looking at the contents of its Blackboard. Display graphs
of agents and plan objects, and some simple metrics. This tool may be run
stand-alone for use with non-CSMART Cougaar societies. See the User's Guide.</li>

<li>
<b>Performance Analyzer: </b>Display metric results from an experiment
in progress, or a completed experiment.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Be sure to separately run the Application (App) Server on each host where you want to
run a node, using one of the supplied Server startup scripts.
<br>To quit CSMART, select File->Exit from the main window, and kill each
of the Servers.<br><br>
<h3>Configuring an Experiment</h3>
Currently, CSMART allows building
and running three types of experiments:
<ul>
<li>
experiments based on more elaborate Cougaar societies in which the basic society definition is obtained from a database, referred to as "database" experiments</li>
<li>
experiments based on Cougaar societies which are defined in files. (These are typically legacy societies, such as simple examples and tutorials.)
</li>
<li>
experiments and societies that are defined entirely from the user interface.  (This approach would be used to define entirely new, but relatively simple societies.)
</ul>
<p><b>To run an experiment from the database (including a previously
defined and saved experiment):</b>
<ol>
<li>
Click the right mouse button on the "Default Workspace" to display a
pop-up menu, or use the Edit menu.  Select "New Experiment -&gt; From
Database" to display a list of experiments defined in the database.
Select the desired experiment from the database. CSMART comes with 6
military logistics based experiments (using 1AD).</li>
<li>If prompted, select the threads and groups for the experiment from the dialog
displayed. You must select at least one thread (or class of supply).</li>
<li>Enter a unique name for your experiment.  
When you exit the dialog, any modified information is written to the database.</li>
<li>If you need to modify the society
or recipes in the experiment, select the component you want to edit in
the workspace, and then select the Configuration Builder. When you exit this tool, any modified information is written to the database.</li>
<li>Select the Experiment Builder and assign agents to nodes and nodes
to hosts.  Also use this tool to specify node arguments and communities.  When you exit this tool, any modified information is written to the database.</li>
<li>Select the Experiment Controller and select the "Run" button near the top of its window.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To create an experiment from (INI) files:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the right mouse button on the "Default Workspace" to display a
pop-up menu, or use the Edit menu.  Select "New Experiment -&gt; From
File" to display a File Chooser. Select a directory containing many
Agent INI files (ie CIP/configs/minitestconfig), or a single Node INI
file listing the Agents you want to run. <b>Note: Only Agents and
their sub-components will be loaded. These will be used to define a
new Society. Any NodeAgent components or Node Binders will not be
loaded. In addition, <i>any extra files (ie OPLAN files) must still be
available on the CONFIG_PATH on all Hosts where you will run the
society.</i> Also note that Agent INI files are those which contain
"[Cluster]", per the original INI file format.</b> Your new Experiment and Society will be named based on
the file or directory you select. </li>
<li>You will then be asked to supply a communities.xml file which
contains Community definitions for your society. If you have none, hit
"Cancel". For a sample such file, look in
CIP/community/data. Communities documentation is available in the
community module.</li>
<li>Your new experiment will be marked modified (red), until you save it in
the Experiment Builder.</li>
<li>You may now edit the new society in the Configuration Builder, and
add Recipes, Nodes, Node Arguments, etc in the Experiment Builder, as
with any other experiment.</li>
<li>Once you save your experiment in the database from the Experiment
Builder, you may load it from the database as per above.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To create an experiment from the UI:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the right mouse button on the "Default Workspace" to display a
pop-up menu, or use the Edit menu.  Select "New Experiment -&gt; From
User". You will be prompted for a unique name for your
experiment. CSMART will automatically create a new, empty society for
that experiment.</li>
<li>Select the new society in the workspace, and then click the
 Configuration Builder button to start editing your society.</li>
<li>In the Configuration Builder, select the root Society node in the
left pane, and use the Pop-up menu to begin adding Agents to your
society. Note that societies include Agents and their sub-components,
but do not include Node Agents or other node-level components. When
you are done creating your society, exit the Configuration Builder to
save it to the database.</li>
<li>Now open the Experiment Builder and add any recipes you like,
creates some Nodes and Hosts, and assign Agents to Nodes to Hosts.</li>
<li>Once you save your experiment in the database from the Experiment
Builder, you may run it or load it from the database as per above.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Typical usage patterns:</b><br>
Typically, users will start with one of the experiments in the
database. Sometimes users will start fresh with a society defined in
files, or create one by hand in the user interface. Then they will
make modifications to this society. When they have large changes, or
changes that they want to repeat (apply to several societies, or
remember to apply again later if their current work is lost), they
will create a Recipe to do the change. But if you want to edit only
one small item, do not need to repeate your edit often, or cannot find
a recipe to do what you need, you may edit the society directly in the
UI.<br>
When you decide to edit your society directly in the UI, you may want
to work with the application of your recipes. For example, you have a
society that you created from the database. You have added or modified
a number of Agents and plugins through recipes. You now realize that you
must edit one or two of the parameters of these added Plugins. But it
is not clear whether the recipes you add over-ride or otherwise
interact with the society definition. You want to see the real
complete definition of the experiment, as it will run, and edit
that. To do so, you may start the Configuration Builder on the
<i>experiment</i> itself. This creates a <i>new</i> society for that
experiment, which includes the result of applying your recipes. You
can now edit using the complete definition of the experiment. However,
you can no-longer remove any of the previous recipes from your
experiment. You may add new recipes to this experiment though.
<br>
<p><h3>To run a tool:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Select the desired experiment, society or recipe (possibly creating a new experiment, society
or recipe),</li>
<li>
Select the desired tool on the pop-up menu on the selected experiment, society or recipe
in the Workspace, or</li>
<li> Select the desired tool from the Edit menu, or </li>
<li>
Select the appropriate tool from the toolbar button.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note that selecting a society or recipe within an experiment modifies only that society or recipe.
Selecting a society or recipe outside of an experiment modifies that society or recipe for
all experiments.</b>
<p>
<b>To activate a tool:</b> The CSMART tools are activated as follows.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Configuration Builder: </b>Enabled when a society or recipe is selected.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Builder: </b>Enabled when an experiment is selected. When the Experiment Builder
tool is selected, a separate Experiment Builder is launched for each selected
experiment. In some situations, the user is prompted to edit, copy, or view the selected experiment. In View mode, the experiment is not modifiable, but the user may view the current configuration.</li>

<li>
<b>Experiment Controller: </b>Always available. May be opened on an
Experiment (which, if it has Agents assigned to Hosts, may be run), or
without. When not running an Experiment, the Controller (aka Console)
may be used to connect to a running experiment.</li>

<li>
<b>Society Monitor: </b>Always activated. It can be used to view
a currently running experiment, to view
previously saved graphs, or to monitor a non-CSMART Cougaar society.
See the User's Guide for details.</li>

<li>
<b>Performance Analyzer: </b>Always activated.</li>
</ul>
CSMART automatically saves your workspace as modifications are made, in the current working
directory. To retrieve previously saved work, Select File-> Open Workspace
from the main CSMART window. Look for the file named according to your
workspace name.<b></b>
<p><b>Workspace</b>
<p>The large lower panel displays the Workspace (aka Organizer). The Workspace is used
to create, edit, rename or delete folders, experiments, societies, and recipes. This is how you organize your work. Note that your work is
automatically saved in the current working directory, under the name you
give your workspace. To open a previously saved workspace, use the File
menu option. You may organize items in the workspace however your
prefer.
<p>As of 9.2.1, it is possible to disable automatic save & restore of
the workspace to a file. See the CSMART startup scripts for details.
<p>
Note that society, recipes, and experiments are each displayed with a
different icon for easy identification.  Entries in the workspace that are displayed in red have been modified
since they were read from the database (or have not been entered in
the database).  Save societies or recipes in the database by invoking
the Configuration Builder on them (or from the Edit menu); on exit from the Configuration
Builder, the societies or recipes being configured will be saved in
the database.  Similarly, save experiments in the database by invoking
the Experiment Builder on them (or from the Edit menu in the Organizer); on exit from the Experiment Builder,
the experiment being built will be saved in the database.  Entries in
the workspace that are displayed in gray cannot be edited; entries are
typically grayed out temporarily when editing other related
information.  For example, when editing an experiment, the
experiment's society and recipes cannot be modified.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Select an item: </b>Point to the item and click the left mouse button.</li>

<li>
<b>Configure, build, rename, copy, or delete: </b>Point to the item and click the
right mouse button; select the appropriate action from the pop-up menu
displayed. You may access the same functions from the Edit menu in the Launcher window.</li>

<li>
<b>Arrange items in workspace: </b>Point to the item, hold the left mouse
button and drag the item to a new location.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Societies</h3>
For CSMART purposes, a Society is a collection of Cougaar Agents and
their components. A society does not include Nodes, Node Agents, or
binders of Agents ("node binders").
<h3>Experiments</h3>
Experiments contain a society, and zero or more recipes which can modify
that society.  Experiments also contain runtime configuration information,
such as the assignment of agents to nodes and nodes to hosts, as well as the
values of node command line arguments.
Experiments define for a society how you will
use available compute resources to run the society. Therefore, an
Experiment adds Hosts, Nodes, etc. 
(An Experiment is, in general, 
made up of one or more trials. Trials are constructed by varying some parameter
- a Plugin parameter, which Agents are run, what Recipes are included,
the distribution of Agents to Nodes or Nodes to Hosts, etc. For each trial,
there may be some results - statistics about the run that are collected
by one of the specified metrics (see below).  Experiments created from
a database cannot vary any parameter, and thus have only one trial.)

<h3>Recipes</h3>
A recipe is a set of rules for modifying a society, by adding one or
more components to the society. Recipes are meant to be used for
multiple societies.  When making in multiple places within a society,
use a recipe. If you want to edit only one item in a society, you may
edit it directly in the Configuration Builder. There are several
built-in recipe templates. By tailoring
these and saving them, users can then retrieve recipes from the
database for later reuse. For example, one recipe might add a certain
plugin to every agent in the society. This recipe could then be used
for any society.
<br><br>To create a recipe, select "New Recipe" from the Edit menu or "Default
Workspace" pop-up menu. Then select "From Template" or "From Database". You
will get a list of the available recipes of each type. Once you have
loaded the recipe, you may configure it by selecting "Configure" from
the pop-up menu on the recipe or from the Edit menu, or by selecting the
Configuration Builder from the toolbar.  Note that you can retrieve
multiple recipes from the database at once by shift- or control-click
selecting them. 
<br><br>To add a recipe to an Experiment, drag it onto the "Recipes"
folder in the Experiment Builder. Recipes can also be duplicated,
deleted, or renamed by using the pop-up menu or Edit menu options.
<h4>Metrics</h4>
A metric is a kind of recipe, a set of run-time statistics about the running society, which
you wish to collect. CSMART allows you to add one or more metrics to your experiment.
Examples might include average and peak CPU utilization, total number of
tasks in the log plan, etc. The frequency 
of sampling is controlled by configuring the recipe using the Configuration Builder tool. See the User's guide for further details.
<h4>Impacts</h4>
An impact is a kind of recipe, an external effect you wish to impose on a running Cougaar
society. For example, loading the network with background traffic, killing
nodes, telling the system some inventory has been lost, etc. These impacts
might be real (really loading up the network), or simulated (via a Binder
on the MessageTransport or some other mechanism).
<h3>Menus</h3>
<h4>File Menu</h4>
The File menu provides basic CSMART Workspace functionality:<br>
<ul><li>Open Workspacee...: Open the named workspace file (for use
when you previously renamed your workspace).</li>
<li>Save New Results In..: Set the directory where node log files and
results files will be stored. Defaults to CIP/results</li>
<li>Exit: Quit CSMART</li>
</ul>

<h4>Edit Menu</h4>
The Edit menu provides quick access to functions also available on the
pop-up menus on items in the workspace.<br>
Items that are available on pop-up menus in the workspace:
<ul><li>New Experiment with a sub-menu for defining the experiment from the database, a file, or the user interface</li>
<li>New Recipe - with sub-items for From Database (pre-configured) or
From Template (configurable in the Configuration Builder)</li>
<li>Delete Experiment From Database (to delete experiments not also in
your workspace)</li>
<li>Delete Recipe From Database (to delete recipes not also in your
workspace)</li>
<li>New Folder - for organizing your workspace</li>
<li>Configure (When a society or recipe is selected, opens the
Configuration Builder on that component. See the above note on editing
the local copy vs the global copy. When an experiment is selected, a
new society is created which combines the society and all recipes in
that experiment, and starts the Configuration Builder on that new society.)</li>
<li>Build (enabled for experiments)</li>
<li>Run (an experiment)</li>
<li>Duplicate (ie. copy)</li>
<li>Rename (to rename an Experiment, society, or recipe)</li>
<li>Save To Database (to force a save now)</li>
<li>Delete (you will be prompted whether to also delete from the database)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Windows Menu</h4>
This menu provides quick access to other open CSMART windows. It will
have one item for each open window.<br>

<h4>Help Menu</h4>
Give help on CSMART. Of particular note is the option to "Show CSMART
Version", which provides the CSMART build information. This is useful
when reporting bugs.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If an appropriate item (experiment or recipe) is not selected in the Workspace,
then the toolbar button will not be activated.</li>

<li>Changes to your workspace are saved automatically.</li>
</ul>
