	* PopulateDb.java (Repository):
	Fix clone-cleaning code. Changed to remove all csmi and hna type
	assemblies.
	(Repository):
	Write component parameters whenever the component is added, not
	just when the lib component is added. Duhhh.
	Properly quote strings containing quotes by doubling them.

	* ComponentData.java (Repository):
	Define HOST constant for identify host ComponentData.

	* PopulateDb.java (Repository):
	Record pre-existing parameters and relationships so new ones can
	be detected and placed in the CSMI assembly rather than the CSHNA
	assembly.
	Handle hosts including host-node mappings.

	* GenericComponentData.java (Repository): 
	* ComponentData.java (Repository): 
	* AgentAssetData.java (Repository):

	* TestPopulateDb.java (Repository):
	Many revisions to adapt to new API of PopulateDb. Mostly concerned
	with distinguishing CMT, CSMART, and CSM assemblies.

	* Experiment.java (Repository):
	Add saveToDB function that writes additional assemblies to the
	database for the host-node-agent assigments, metrics, and impacts.

	* PopulateDb.java (Repository):
	Many modifications to treat CMT, CSMART, and CSM assemblies
	separately. Added experiment/trial cloning and cleaning.

	* PopulateDb.java (Repository):
	Use alib id from ComponentData when available. Clean out other CSM
	assemblies from the current trial before populating with new
	condiments.

	* PopulateDb.java (Repository):
	New class populates the config database from a ComponentData
	structure.

	* ComponentData.java (Repository):

	* PropertyEvent.java (Repository): 
	* Property.java (Repository): 
	* ConfigurableComponent.java (Repository):
	Add versions of "addProperty" to add invisible properties. This
	avoids the window of inopportunity between adding the property and
	making it invisible. The added methods are named
	addInvisibleProperty.
