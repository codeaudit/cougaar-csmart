2001-12-10  Aaron Helsinger  <ahelsing@clarinet.bbn.com>

	* CMT.java, CSMARTConsole.java, ChangeLog, ConsoleInternalFrame.java, NodeArgumentDialog.java, NodeArgumentTableModel.java:
	Merge changes from 862 branch. See branch comments. Changes include:
	CSMART Console: Fixed bug 824 -- make "exception" be the default notification string.
	HostConfigurationBuilder: Ensure that node names and agent names are unique as they occupy the
	same name space.  Fixes bug 810.
	ui/console:
	Fixed bugs 771, 891, 893:
	Can provide local and global command line arguments from a file (use the
	"Command Line Arguments" and "Global Command Line Arguments" menu items
	on the node in ExperimentBuilder -- there's a new button in the pop-up dialog
	-- "Read From File").
	Prevent user editing arguments that shouldn't be edited (such as node
	name).

	* ReadOnlyProperties.java:
	Fix bug 893
	Extends java.util.Properties by adding a Set of keys that should
	be immutable (or mutable only in a controlled way). The put,
	putAll, remove, and clear methods are overridden to disallow
	modifications or removal of the read-only keys. Additional methods
	allow these values to be changed when needed.

	* Experiment.java:
	Fix bug 893
	Change defaultNodeArguments to be ReadOnlyProperties. Make the
	"...experiment.id" property be read-only and set its value
	whenever the trialId is changed.
	Simplify the copying of properties when copying the node.

	* ExperimentNode.java:
	Fix bug 893
	Change "arguments" to be ReadOnlyProperties. Make the
	"...node.name" property be readonly and set its value only when
	renaming the node.
	Simplify the copying of properties when copying the node.

	* NodeComponent.java:
	Fix bug 893
	Remove the setArguments method. It is unnecessary and problematic
	since it implies that the arguments of a node can be alter in a
	will-nilly fashion. The only permitted actions are the editing of
	the Properties returned by getArguments().

	Experiment: Changed default node argument from:
	org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.enabled
	to
	org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.enable (no final d)

	If user exits Experiment Builder and hasn't modified the experiment,
	then don't query about saving the experiment.
	If user selects Save As menu item, then just save the experiment,
	regardless of whether or not it's been modified.
	These are additional fixes on bug 883.

	CSMARTConsole: Fixed bug 851 -- if user doesn't specify results (metrics) directory,
	then don't run the experiment (in ExperimentController).

	CMT.java: Fix bug 885
	Remove code that tries to remove the society component when
	deleting an experiment. This violates foreign key constraints
	against the component_hierarchy and component_arg tables. Let the
	assembly cleanup code take care of this.

	ui/viewer:
	Allow re-use of experiment name when configuring an experiment (bug #883).
	Experiment: Removed isCloned/setCloned methods; no longer used.
	ExperimentBuilder: Added Save As menu item and method; call SaveAs method when user exits
	ExperimentBuilder (by closing window or invoking File-Close menu item).
	CMTDialog: Allow user to save experiment under original name.
	CSMART: Pass through "allowExistingName" flag to getUniqueExperimentName.
	Organizer: Added flag to getUniqueExperimentName to allow reuse of existing name.
	Removed use of Experiment isCloned/setCloned.

	ui/component:
	* PDbBase.java:
	* PopulateDb.java:
	Fix bug 883.
	Clone the experiment being saved if and only if its name is
	different from the name in the database for the experiment
	identified by the experiment id. Ignore arg saying whether to
	createNew or not. If the name differs, it must be cloned. If the
	name is the same it cannot be cloned.
	Set experiment and trial descriptions rationally. Select
	experiment and trial ids more reasonbably.

	* Organizer.java:
	Fix bug 882
	When reading society and node properties replace all default
	values with values from the database if there are _any_ values in
	the database.

	* HostConfigurationBuilder.java:
	* Experiment.java:
	More Fix bug 853
	Fix problem in retaining nameserver host property. This
	computation was done far too often including cases where the
	complete list of hosts nodes and agents was not available.
	Move the code to do this computation from builder to Experiment.
	Do the computation before handing out the experiments list of
	Nodes. This insures that any code that looks at the nodes'
	properties will see an up=to=date computation of this property.


	* Organizer.java:
	Fix bug 878
	Allow deletion if the recipe differs as well as if it exists.

	* Experiment.java:
	Fix bug 876
	Save agent properties. This allows recipe added agents to be
	marked with a property so they can be identified when read from
	the database. This allows old recipe agents to be removed.

	* PopulateDb.java:
	Fix bug 876
	Provide a way to repopulate the CMT part of an experiment. The CMT
	part is normal read-only, but if a recipe deletes some part of the
	CMT assembly, the only way to represent that is to replace the old
	CMT with a new omitting or changing as necessary.

	* PDbBase.java:
	Fix bug 876
	Save only local properties for a recipe.

	* GenericComponentData.java:
	Fix bug 876
	setChildren must clear old children before setting new ones
	otherwise they just keep building up.

	* ConfigurableComponent.java:
	* ComponentProperties.java:
	Fix bug 876
	Provide mechanism to indicate removed (renamed) agents.

	* PopulateDb.java:
	Fix bug 875
	Improve detection of inserted/replaced arguments to not falsely
	indicate removal when none has happened.

	* CMTAgent.java:
	Fix bug 876
	Allow construction without assemblyId for the case where the agent
	has not yet been put in the database.

	Fixed Bug: #873
	Agent Insertion Recipe now provides the ability to
	toggle the inclusion of OrgAssets and ItemIdentificationPG's.
	If an OrgAsset is Included, a ClusterPG is created as well.
	ItemIdentificationPG's are required for all agents except
	Prototypes.

	Fixed bug #841 -- allow forced editing of a recipe that is included
	in an experiment that has been run.

2001-12-10  Ginny Travers  <travers@clarinet.bbn.com>

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Fixed bug 824 -- make "exception" be the default notification string.

2001-12-06  Ginny Travers  <travers@clarinet.bbn.com>

	* ConsoleInternalFrame.java, NodeArgumentDialog.java, NodeArgumentTableModel.java, CSMARTConsole.java:
	Fixed bugs 771, 891, 893:
	Can provide local and global command line arguments from a file (use the
	"Command Line Arguments" and "Global Command Line Arguments" menu items
	on the node in ExperimentBuilder -- there's a new button in the pop-up dialog
	-- "Read From File").
	Prevent user editing arguments that shouldn't be edited (such as node name).

	* ChangeLog: *** empty log message ***

2001-12-05  Ginny Travers  <travers@clarinet.bbn.com>

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Fixed bug 851 -- if user doesn't specify results (metrics) directory,

2001-11-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Fix bug 853
	Remove dead code involving nameserver settings.

2001-11-20  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ConsoleInternalFrame.java:
	Move initial position code out of here. Only the desktop has
	enough information to determine where to put the frame.

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Set initial positions of frames to be on screen. This is in
	addition to watching the components move.

2001-11-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Pass "arguments" to appserver.

	* NodeArgumentDialog.java:
	Add JTextArea for collection command line arguments. Add column
	indicating if a -D option is global or not. (Needs more work).

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Extract just the -D command line options from the node arguments.
	Omit the COMMAND_ARGUMENTS option.

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Fix bug 790.
	Force internal frames of experiment controller desktop to be at
	least partially within the desktop. Initial position forces as
	much of the frame to be visible as possible. Repositioning the
	frame or resizing the desktop moves the internal frames to leave
	at least enough of the frame visible that it can be dragged back
	onto the desktop.

2001-11-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Force top-left corner of internal frames to be within the desktop
	by at least 20 pixels. This insures they can be seen and
	manipulated.

2001-11-08  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* SelectedColoredCircle.java:
	Extend ColorCircle and set "selected" boolean to cause outline to
	be drawn. Most code is now gone.

	* ColoredCircle.java:
	Merge with SelectedColoredCircle to avoid code duplication and
	accidental differences.
	Leave a margin around the circle to avoid clipping the outline or
	the anti-aliasing fringe.

2001-11-07  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* CMT.java:
	Fix deleteExperiment. Code assumed that trial ids had a particular
	form. That form did not match trial ids assigned when clonging an
	experiment prior to adding host-node-agent mappings and recipes.
	Fix is to query the db for the trial id of the experiment.
