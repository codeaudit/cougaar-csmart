	* ConsoleInternalFrame.java:
	Move initial position code out of here. Only the desktop has
	enough information to determine where to put the frame.

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Set initial positions of frames to be on screen. This is in
	addition to watching the components move.

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Pass "arguments" to appserver.

	* NodeArgumentDialog.java:
	Add JTextArea for collection command line arguments. Add column
	indicating if a -D option is global or not. (Needs more work).

	* CSMARTConsole.java:
	Extract just the -D command line options from the node arguments.
	Omit the COMMAND_ARGUMENTS option.

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Fix bug 790.
	Force internal frames of experiment controller desktop to be at
	least partially within the desktop. Initial position forces as
	much of the frame to be visible as possible. Repositioning the
	frame or resizing the desktop moves the internal frames to leave
	at least enough of the frame visible that it can be dragged back
	onto the desktop.

	* ConsoleDesktop.java:
	Force top-left corner of internal frames to be within the desktop
	by at least 20 pixels. This insures they can be seen and
	manipulated.

	* SelectedColoredCircle.java:
	Extend ColorCircle and set "selected" boolean to cause outline to
	be drawn. Most code is now gone.

	* ColoredCircle.java:
	Merge with SelectedColoredCircle to avoid code duplication and
	accidental differences.
	Leave a margin around the circle to avoid clipping the outline or
	the anti-aliasing fringe.

	* CMT.java:
	Fix deleteExperiment. Code assumed that trial ids had a particular
	form. That form did not match trial ids assigned when clonging an
	experiment prior to adding host-node-agent mappings and recipes.
	Fix is to query the db for the trial id of the experiment.
