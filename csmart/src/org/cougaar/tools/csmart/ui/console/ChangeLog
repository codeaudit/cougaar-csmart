	* SelectedColoredCircle.java:
	Extend ColorCircle and set "selected" boolean to cause outline to
	be drawn. Most code is now gone.

	* ColoredCircle.java:
	Merge with SelectedColoredCircle to avoid code duplication and
	accidental differences.
	Leave a margin around the circle to avoid clipping the outline or
	the anti-aliasing fringe.

	* CMT.java:
	Fix deleteExperiment. Code assumed that trial ids had a particular
	form. That form did not match trial ids assigned when clonging an
	experiment prior to adding host-node-agent mappings and recipes.
	Fix is to query the db for the trial id of the experiment.
