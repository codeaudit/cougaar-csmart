<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<h3>Experiment Controller</h3>
The Experiment Controller is used to control running an experiment. 
The Experiment Controller is enabled only when an experiment that 
contains a society is selected in the workspace.
The Experiment Controller allows the user to run through all Trials
automatically, to stop after a Trial completes, or to abort a Trial.
Trials are defined in the Experiment Builder.
A Trial is one "run" of a Society with all Unbound Properties bound
to one set of values as specified in the Experiment Builder.
<p>Note that you must separately launch the Server on each host used in
the experiment. See the installation instructions for running the Server.
<br>
<b>Controlling the Experiment</b>
<ul>
<li>
Select the "Run" button to run an experiment.</li>
<li>
Select the "Stop" button to stop a trial in an experiment.
If the Society in the Experiment is configured to stop automatically
at the end of each trial, then this merely stops the experiment
at the end of the current trial.
If the Society is not configured to stop automatically,
then this stops the current trial immediately.
In the latter case, if the Society Monitor tool is monitoring the experiment, 
you will be asked to confirm the Stop action.</li>
<li>
Select the "Abort" button to abort the trial, ending it immediately.</li>
</ul>
<b>Information from a Running Experiment</b>
<br>The information about a node in a running experiment can be displayed
by selecting the Node’s tab in
the tabbed panels, or by selecting that Node’s “Node Status” button. Selecting
a node brings the following information for that node to the foreground.
<ul>
<li>
The standard output and standard error channels from each node in the experiment
are displayed in a tabbed pane on the right side of the Experiment Controller.
Output is displayed in black, and errors are displayed in red.</li>

<li>
A colored circle following the “Node Status” label near the top right of
the Experiment Controller illustrates the node status. The status of the
currently selected node is displayed as a filled circle; the statuses of
unselected nodes are displayed as hollow circles. The node color indicates
the node status: red for error (as when the Node has been killed), gray
for unknown, and green for busy status (lighter green implies busier).</li>

<li>
Selecting the Node-Utilization History menu item, or clicking on the Node
Status icon for that Node displays the Utilization History, a graph of
“Load vs. Time”.</li>
</ul>
In addition, the Configuration and "Trial Values" tabbed panes on the left
present non-editable views of information about the Trial.  The Configuration
tab displays the Host-Node-Agent configuration which was specified in
the Experiment Builder.  The "Trial Values" tab displays all the values being
used in the current Trial; this is a combination of the properties specified
in the Configuration Builder and the Trial values specified in the Experiment
Builder.
<p>
The progress bar indicates the number of trials that have been run, as
a percentage of the number of trials defined for the experiment in the
Experiment Builder.
The Trial time indicates the time that the Trial has been running.
The Experiment time indicates the total time that the Experiment has
been running.
<h3>Notes:</h3>
If either of these error messages is displayed
<blockquote>Cannot write configuration on hostname; check that server is
running
<br>Cannot create node on hostname; check that server is running</blockquote>
then ensure that all hosts are referenced by full IP address or fully qualified
machine name. Also, in some cases, it appears that Solaris machines fail
to contact the NameService on Win32 machines.
<p>Also, if you get an error in your server console window, saying something
like: "RMI Exception: Class not found", or "RMI Exception: no RMI class
loader", this is usually a classpath problem. Be sure that both server.jar
and csmart.jar are on the classpath used to run the server, the classpath
defined in your server properties file, and in the classpath for running
CSMART. In addition, ensure that all your jar files (CSMART and other Cougaar
jar files) are from the same build; rebuild the CSMART jar file against
the Cougaar jars you are using if necessary.
