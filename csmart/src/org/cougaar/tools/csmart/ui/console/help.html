<h2>
Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
Thank you for evaluating this prototype!
<h3>
Experiment Controller</h3>
The Experiment Controller is used to assign resources (machines) to an
experiment and to control running an experiment. The Experiment Controller
is enabled only when an experiment that contains a society is selected
in the workspace. The Experiment Controller displays three trees of information:
Hosts, Unassigned Nodes, and Unassigned Agents. The Hosts tree is initialized
from the hosts.txt file, retrieved from org.cougaar.config.path, and typically
in the directory from which CSMART is launched; hosts can be added to the
Hosts tree as described below.
<p>Note that you must separately launch the Server on each host used in
the experiment. See the installation instructions for running the Server.
<p><b>Configuring the Experiment</b>
<ol>
<li>
In the Hosts tree, create an entry for each host to be used in the experiment.
An entry for a host can be created:</li>

<ul>
<li>
By adding the host name to the hosts.txt file in the directory from which
CSMART is launched, or</li>

<li>
By clicking the right mouse button over the "Hosts" folder in the Experiment
Controller. A pop-up menu is displayed; select "New Host" from this menu.
A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter the name of the host.</li>

<li>
Note that hosts named "localhost", or host names that do not include the
full domain name (ie cougaar.org), sometimes fail (due to an RMI bug).
If you see:</li>

<pre>!Waiting for //127.0.0.1:8888/NameService!.!.!.</pre>
this usually indicates a problem. Try using an IP address or fully qualified
host name.</ul>

<li>
Create a node or nodes for each host to be used in the experiment. Click
the right mouse button over the host folder in the "Hosts" tree, and select
"New Node" from the menu. A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter
the name of the node.</li>

<li>
Assign agents to nodes. Drag and drop agents from the "Unassigned Agents"
tree to the nodes created in the previous step. To select a group of agents,
left click on the first agent to select, and shift left click on the last
agent.</li>
</ol>
<b>Controlling the Experiment</b>
<ul>
<li>
Select the "Run" button to run an experiment.</li>

<li>
Select the "Stop" button to stop the experiment. If the Society Monitor
tool is monitoring the experiment, you will be asked to confirm the Stop
action.</li>

<li>
Select the "Abort" button to abort the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<b>Information from a Running Experiment</b>
<br>The following information is displayed from a running experiment:
<ul>
<li>
The standard output and standard error channels from each node in the experiment
are displayed in a tabbed pane on the right side of the Experiment Controller.
Output is displayed in black, and errors are displayed in red.</li>

<li>
A colored circle following the “Node Status” label near the top right of
the Experiment Controller illustrates the node status. The status of the
currently selected node is displayed as a filled circle; the statuses of
unselected nodes are displayed as hollow circles. The node color indicates
the node status: red for error (as when the Node has been killed), gray
for unknown, and green for busy status (lighter green implies busier).</li>

<li>
Selecting the Node-Utilization History menu item, or clicking on the Node
Status icon for that Node displays the Utilization History, a graph of
“Load vs. Time”.</li>
</ul>
<b>Additional Functionality</b>
<p>The configuration of Hosts, Unassigned Nodes, and Unassigned Agents
can be modified using pop-up menus or by drag-and-drop. Agents can be dropped
on nodes; nodes can be dropped on hosts. Create, delete, and rename hosts
and nodes by right clicking on a host or node to display a pop-up menu
with these options. Agents are created by Societies and cannot be created,
deleted or renamed in the Experiment Controller. Unassigned Agents are
agents not assigned to a node.
<br>The information about a node in a running experiment can be displayed
by selecting the node in the Hosts tree, by selecting the Node’s tab in
the tabbed panels, or by selecting that Node’s “Node Status” button. Selecting
a node brings all the information for that node to the foreground.
<h3>
Notes:</h3>
If either of these error messages is displayed
<blockquote>Cannot write configuration on hostname; check that server is
running
<br>Cannot create node on hostname; check that server is running</blockquote>
then ensure that all hosts are referenced by full IP address or fully qualified
machine name. Also, in some cases, it appears that Solaris machines fail
to contact the NameService on Win32 machines.
<p>Also, if you get an error in your server console window, saying something
like: "RMI Exception: Class not found", or "RMI Exception: no RMI class
loader", this is usually a classpath problem. Be sure that both server.jar
and csmart.jar are on the classpath used to run the server, the classpath
defined in your server properties file, and in the classpath for running
CSMART. In addition, ensure that all your jar files (CSMART and other Cougaar
jar files) are from the same build; rebuild the CSMART jar file against
the Cougaar jars you are using if necessary.
