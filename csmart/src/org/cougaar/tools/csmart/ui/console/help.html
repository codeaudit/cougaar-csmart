<h2>Experiment Controller</h2>
The Experiment Controller (or Console) is used to control a
running experiment. This experiment may be one started from the
console, or one that was already running, and to which the console is
"attached".
<p>The Experiment Controller collects and displays all output from the
nodes in the experiment, and provides several facilities for
automatically and manually searching this ouput, and notifying the
user of error conditions.<br>
The console keeps a list of active Application Servers (usually
defined by the hosts in the selected experiment), which you can add or
remove from. These servers are regularly polled for new Nodes to which
you can "attach".<br>
<p>Note that you must separately launch the AppServer on each host used in
the experiment. See the installation instructions for running the Server.
<br>
<br>
A typical usage would be to <ol>
<li>Start the AppServers.</li>
<li>Set the node output <a href="#FILTER">filters</a>, <a href="#VSIZE">view buffer size</a>, and
<a href="#Notify">notifications</a>.</li>
<li>Start the Experiment</li>
<li>Monitor the Node's output</li>
<li><a href="#GLS">Publish</a> the OPLAN and send GLS Root, where appropriate</li>
<li>Launch the Society Monitor</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Controlling the Experiment</b>
<ul>
<li>
Select the "Run" button to run an experiment.</li>
<li>
Select the "Stop" button to stop the experiment.
If the Society in the experiment is configured to stop automatically,
then this merely stops the experiment when the society stops (no societies
currently stop automatically).
If the society is not configured to stop automatically, 
then this stops the experiment immediately.
</li>
</ul>
<li>If CSMART was killed unexpectedly, or another CSMART user started
the experiment, you may instead select "Attach" to attach to nodes
that may be available on the selected Application Servers. Once you
have attached to nodes, all functionality is exactly as if you had
originally started the Nodes via the "Run" button.</li>
<li>When you exit the Console, if there are Nodes still running, you
will be prompted to Kill the Nodes, or simply "detach" from the Nodes,
leaving them running.</li>
<p>
<b>Information from a Running Experiment</b>
<br>When you start an experiment, a window is created to capture the
output of each node.  
The node's window displays information about a node in a running experiment; a brief description of the node's status can also be displayed by selecting that node's &quot;Node Status&quot; button.
<ul>
<li>
The node's window displays the standard output and standard error channels from each node in the experiment, together with some additional specific event information (Node created, Node destroyed).
Output is displayed in black, and errors are displayed in red.  This
output can be filtered using the <a href="#FILTER">global
filters</a>.  The full output of the node is captured in a per-node
<a href="#Info">log file</a>.</li>
<li>
<a NAME="NodeStatusButton">The Node Status button</a> (a colored circle following the &quot;Node Status&quot; label near the top of
the Experiment Controller) illustrates the node status. The color
of the circle indicates the relative load on the node (how busy or idle it is);
an exclamation mark in the circle indicates an error condition.
The circle corresponding to the currently selected node is outlined in black.
Clicking the right mouse button over the node status button displays a menu with the following options:
<ul>
<li>
Information: Information about the node and the host on which it is running.
</li>
<li>
Reset: Reset (remove) the error mark on the button.  Continue scanning the output from the node for new error conditions.
</li>
<li>
Node Status Legend: A legend explaining the colors of the node status button.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
In addition, the "Configuration" 
window displays the Host-Node-Agent configuration which was specified in
the Experiment Builder (if you started the experiment from this Console). To see the current dynamic configuration, use
the Topology view in the Society Monitor.
<p>
The experiment time indicates the total time that the experiment has
been running.
<h3>Saving Experiment Results</h3>
The Experiment Controller saves the node output into per-node log
files, and retrieves any generated results from all the hosts used in the
experiment and stores these by default in the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/results folder.
To change the location for storing results, use the CSMART File menu, "Save New Results in..." menu item.
For a description
of the experiment results hierarchy, see the Help information for the
Performance Analyzer.
<h3>Experiment Controller Menus</h3>
The Experiment Controller menus are as follows:
<ul>
<li>File</li>
<ul>
<li>Close: Close the Experiment Controller.</li>
</ul>
<li><a NAME=View>View</a></li>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="VSIZE">Set View Size</a>: Set the number of characters
displayed in each node's window, or select "all" to display all the
output from the node.  For efficiency, select a reasonable number of
characters to display.  The entire output from each node is always
available in the <a href="#Info">log file</a>.</li>
<li><a NAME="FILTER">Filter</a>: Select the types of messages that are
written in the node's window.  For efficiency, select only the
messages that are important.  The entire output from each node is
always available in the log file. The full path of the log file is
displayed using the <a href="#Info">Node Info</a> menu in the Node
Windows menu.</li> The types of messages that can be displayed are:
<ul>
<li>Standard Output: Output written on the standard output stream.
</li>
<li>Standard Error: Output written on the standard error stream.
</li>
<li>Node Created: The node was created.
</li>
<li>Node Destroyed: The node process was killed.
</li>
<li>Idle: Controls the color of the node status button.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
In future, you may also be able to filter by Log4J logging level.<br>
<li><a NAME="Notify">Notify</a>
<br>This menu allows users to set up "Notifications".  CSMART
automatically scans all output from all nodes searching for the notify
conditions set by the user.  If a notification condition is detected,
an exclamation mark is displayed in the <a
href="#NodeStatusButton">node's status button</a>.  Output is scanned
starting at the time that the notification is set.    Notify
conditions can be either a specified string, or any output on Standard
Error.  Note that notification strings are case <i>in</i>sensitive.
Thus, for example, the user could ask for a notification, if
the node writes the string "not found". Notifications set here can be
overridden by specific notifications set in each node's window.
Initially, the notification string is set to "exception" so that any
exceptions caught at a node will trigger a notification.</li>
<ul>
<li>Set Notification: Set the string on which to be notified; optionally ask to be notified for all output on Standard Error.</li>
<li>View Notification: View the current notify string.</li>
<li>Remove All Notifications: Remove all notify conditions.</li>
<li>Reset All Notifications: Reset the error marks in the node status
buttons, and continue to search for notify conditions, starting with
any <i>new</i> output from the nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application Server
<br>
This menu controls how CSMART monitors available Application
Servers. CSMART will watch a list of Application Servers to see which
ones are running, and whether any have Nodes running, or have new
Nodes start on them. For example, if part of your society dynamically starts a
new Node, a dialog box will appear to notify you.<br>
The list of Servers which CSMART monitors is usually set by the list
of Hosts in your experiment (the port is defined by the
<code>org.cougaar.control.port</code> parameter on your Nodes, which
defaults to 8484). You
may View, Add to, or Delete from the servers in this list using menu
items here. By default, CSMART will poll these host/port combinations
every 30 seconds (this interval can be modified using the "Set Poll
Interval" menu item, or disabled by setting it to 0. If disabled, use
"Refresh" to manually poll the servers). When there are new Nodes running, the Attach button
will be enabled. By selecting one or more Nodes to attach to, you get
a Node output window, exactly as if you had started that Node using
the Run button. You can then individually kill and restart that Node,
as usual. At that point, hitting "Stop" will stop all the Nodes which
you are monitoring -- both those started from a local experiment, and 
those to which you attached.<br>
<ul>
<li>View: View a list of the Application Servers being monitored.</li>
<li>Add...: Add a new host/port combination to monitor.</li>
<li>Delete....: Remove an Application server from the list to monitor.</li>
<li>Attach...: (Same as hitting the Attach Button): Attach to Nodes
not yet attached. You will get a window listing Nodes to attach to,
from which you can select one or more.</li>
<li>Kill Any Nodes: Kill any running Nodes on any of the monitored
AppServers. Warning: This will kill <i>all</i> nodes on those servers,
so be sure you do not kill someone else's society. This would usually
be used to clean up before doing a fresh run.</li>
<li>Refresh: Manually refresh the list of running AppServers (by
polling all the host/ports in the "View" list), and the list of Nodes
running on those servers.</li>
<li>Set Poll Interval: Set the interval (in milliseconds) betwen
polling the list of App Servers for new Nodes. The default is 30,000
(30 seconds). Set it to 0 to disable polling.</li>
<li>Add GLS Client: When attaching to a running experiment, used to
create a new GLS Client for publishing the OPLAN in this experiment,
and sending GLS root.</li>

<h3>Node Window Menus</h3>
The Node Window menus are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Node</li>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="Info">Info</a>: Displays information about the node and
the machine on which it is running.  Displays the name of the log
file, which can be easily cut and pasted into a text editor.  Displays
the host location and description and the node description; this
information can be added to the host and node in the Experiment
Builder. Also shows the command line arguments and agents as
originally configured to run on the Node (if the Node was started from
this Console). If you click on the Agent
name, you can see the components configured to run in that Agent (only
available for Nodes started from this CSMART).</li>
<li>Machine CPU Usage: Displays CPU usage for all processes on the machine on which the node is running.  (This information is not supported for Windows machines.)</li>
<li>Node CPU Usage: Displays CPU usage for the Node's processes and child processes.  (This information is not displayed for Windows machines.)</li>
</ul>
<li>Edit: Edit the text in the node window.</li>
<ul>
<li>Cut: Remove selected text and put it on the system clipboard.</li>
<li>Copy: Copy the selected text to the system clipboard.</li>
<li>Paste: Paste text from the system clipboard, at the cursor location.</li>
<li>Select All: Select all the text in the node window.</li>
<li>Find: Find the specified string in the node window; sets the cursor at the end of the string and highlights the string.</li>
<li>Find Next: Find the next instance of the string specified in "Find".</li>
</ul>
<li>View: These menu items are the same as in the Experiment Controller menus, but control the view for the specific node.  See <a href=#View>View menu.</a></li>
<ul>
<li>Set View Size</li>
<li>Filter</li>
</ul>
<li>Control</li>
<ul>
<li>Stack Trace: Causes the node to print a stack trace; this is
displayed in the standard output in the node window.  (This is not
supported for Windows machines.)</li>
<li>Kill: Kill the selected node.</li>
<li>Restart: Restart the node, if it has died.  If you have
persistence turned on (default setting), the node will start where it
left off. This is regardless of any setting for the persistence.clear
flag.</li>
</ul>
<li>Notify: These menu items are the same as in the Experiment Controller menus, but set notifications for the specific node.  See <a href=#Notify>Notify menu.</a></li>
<ul>
<li>Set Notification</li>
<li>Remove Notification</li>
<li>Find Next Notification</li>
<li>Reset Notification</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><a NAME="GLS">GLS and OPLAN UI</h3>
In societies which use an Oplan, a window will pop up in the CSMART Console for
publishing an Oplan, and sending or rescinding the GLS Root task. This
interface uses a servlet to communicate with the command node (usually
NCA). To use this interface:
<ul>
<li>Wait for the Node creation to quiesce (this wait is very important).</li>
<li>Hit the "Connect" button, and</li>
<li>then immediately the "Publish OPLAN"
button.</li>
<li>Wait for the OPLAN publishing work to quiesce.</li>
<li>Publish GLS Root</li>
<li>You may then rescind that task, or publish another</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
If this error message is displayed:
<pre>Cannot create node on hostname; check that server is running</pre>
then ensure that all hosts are referenced by full IP address or fully qualified
machine name. Also, in some cases, it appears that Solaris machines fail
to contact the NameService on Win32 machines.
<p>Also, errors in the server console window, such as: "RMI Exception: Class not found", or "RMI Exception: no RMI class
loader", usually indicate a classpath problem. Be sure that both server.jar
and csmart.jar are on the classpath used to run the server, the classpath
defined in the server properties file, and in the classpath for
running CSMART.<br>
<p>Finally, with Cougaar 9.2.1 or better, be sure that your AppServer properties file
contains the "java.Xbootclasspath/p" argument, which is now
required (without this you will see a message like "Fatal error
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: newInstanceFromDesc"). In addition, 
some Cougaar Nodes (particularly those running an AggAgent) should be run using the JDK Hotspot Server VM, not the
Client VM that comes with the JRE. To do so, your AppServer properties
file must include the java.server argument, and JDK_HOME/bin must be
early in your Path. The corresponding error indicates something like:
"Error: no `server' JVM at `C:\Program
Files\Java\j2re1.4.0\bin\server\jvm.dll'."<br>
<p>In general, most errors running societies can be traced to one of
the following:<br>
<ul><li>Firewall issues between CSMART machine and Node machines</li>
<li>DNS problems on Node machines - be sure you can nslookup and
reverse nslookup each machine name.</li>
<li>AppServer not running, or Node machine has wrong version of
Cougaar.</li>
<li>Node machine has incorrect cougaar.rc or other data file</li>
</ul>
