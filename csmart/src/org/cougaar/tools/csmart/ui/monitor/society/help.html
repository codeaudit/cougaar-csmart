<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<h3>Society Monitor Society View</h3>
The Society Monitor's Agents View displays the agents in a running Cougaar
society. Each agent is labeled with its nomenclature. It is linked to every
other agent with which it has a relationship. Agents are laid out top-to-bottom.
You may produce new graphs showing only selected relationships, from the
File menu. Alternatively, given a selected agent, you can highlight those
agents with which that agent has a given relationship (as pictured below).
<br>As with all graph views, a Legend indicates the color scheme. Additionally,
each node has a set of attributes of the organization available (by double-clicking
or from the View menu when an agent is selected).
