<h2>Topology Table</h2>
This table displays the host, node, agent, and incarnation number for each
agent in the society.  The incarnation number is the number of times that
the node has been started (or restarted); it is initially one.  Additional information supplied by the agent is shown in additional columns.
<h3>Sorting</h3>
The table columns can be sorted alphabetically or numerically by clicking
the left mouse button on the column header.  For reverse ordering, hold the Shift key.
<h3>Column Sizing</h3>
The table columns can be resized by positioning the mouse over the border between two columns in the column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the border to the new location.
<h3>Column Reordering</h3>
The table columns can be reordered by positioning the mouse over a column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the column to a new location.
<h2>Topology Tree</h2>
The tree also displays the host, node, and agent.  The incarnation number and any additional information from the agent is displayed as a tool tip on the agent node in the tree.
