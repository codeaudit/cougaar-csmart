<h2>Topology Table</h2>
This table displays the host, node, agent, and incarnation number for each
agent in the society, as it changes during the run of a society.  The incarnation number is the number of times that
the node has been started (or restarted); it is initially one.
Additional information supplied by the agent is shown in additional
columns. This view is useful for viewing moving Agents and Agent
restarts. The data displayed here can be manually refreshed (via the
"Refresh" button or the View menu option), or continuously (by setting
the Refresh Interval from the View menu).<br>
The left-hand pane shows a complete table of the topology information
fro the society, as available from the TopologyService. The right-hand
pane shows the same information as a tree.

<h3>Sorting</h3>
The table columns can be sorted alphabetically or numerically by clicking
the left mouse button on the column header.  For reverse ordering, hold the Shift key.
<h3>Column Sizing</h3>
The table columns can be resized by positioning the mouse over the border between two columns in the column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the border to the new location.
<h3>Column Reordering</h3>
The table columns can be reordered by positioning the mouse over a column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the column to a new location.
<h2>Topology Tree</h2>
The tree also displays the host, node, and agent.  The incarnation number and any additional information from the agent is displayed as a tool tip on the agent node in the tree.
