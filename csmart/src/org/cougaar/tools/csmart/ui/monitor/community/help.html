<h2>Community View</h2>
This view shows the communities in a Cougaar society.<br>
<b>Warning: The communities displayed with this view are not currently
the same as those created through the CommunityService and the yellow
pages. Instead, it uses the CommunityPG. A future version may use the
CommunityService information.</b><br>
Every Organization or Entity in a Cougaar society may choose to
indicate
the time-phased collection of communities to which it belongs. If the
society being displayed has such data, this view will show all of the
communities in the society, and their relationships. The default
community displayed is named COUGAAR, so this is what you will see in
many cases, where the required CommunityPG is not included.<br>
The relationships between communities are calculated based on the
relationships among the agents in those communities, as specified by
the Relationships in each Agent's configuration.<br>
