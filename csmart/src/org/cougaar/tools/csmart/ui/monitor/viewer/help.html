<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<h3>Society Monitor</h3>
The Society Monitor displays the activities and data associated with a
distributed running Cougaar society. This data is obtained by collecting
information from the contents of each agent's Blackboard, or from the results
of specific metrics collection Plugins (or by loading saved graph or metrics
data). This tool allows users to monitor any currently running Cougaar
society.
<p>Views within this tool communicate via the standard PSP interface with
a running society. When running under CSMART, the Society Monitor is enabled
only when an experiment is running, and automatically contacts the society
in the running experiment. When running standalone, the user is prompted
for a URL in the running society. To run the Society Monitor in stand-alone
mode, ensure that the CSMART PSPs are included in your default.psps.xml
and loaded in each agent of your society. Then use one of the included
Monitor scripts to start the Society Monitor. This is also the easiest
way to open saved graphs. Note that the Society Monitor uses the AT&amp;T
GraphViz package for graph layout &amp; rendering. This package minimizes
distance between linked nodes, and minimizes link overlap. It does not
include any other factors in graph layout.
<p>The Society Monitor provides the following displays:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Community: </b>The communities in the society, if specified. </li>

<li>
<b>Agents: </b>The agents in the society and their relationships to each
other.</li>

<li>
<b>Plan: </b>The plan objects in the society, including Assets, Workflows,
Tasks, Allocations, Dispositions, Asset Transfers, Aggregations, and Expansions.</li>

<li>
<b>Thread: </b>Drill down on the whole plan, and display only objects related
to a single plan object.</li>

<li>
<b>Metrics</b>: Show one (potentially many) calculated graph of society
activity.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
When first launching a tool, if not running from CSMART, you are prompted
for the URL of the society to contact. Supply the appropriate host and
port number, just as you would for any PSP (see the settings in your alpreg.ini
file). You may launch as many different views as you wish. In future, you
will be able to use the selection in one tool to drive your view in another.
When launching the plan view, you are prompted to filter your query.
<p><b>Society Monitor Menus</b>
<br>From the Society Monitor main display, you may launch one of the views,
or load a saved data set, using the following menu items.
<ul>
<li>
File: Create new graphs, save graphs, and exit.</li>

<ul>
<li>
New: Create a new Agents, Plan or Thread graph. This duplicates the functionality
available on the tool bar buttons.</li>

<li>
Open: Read and display a previously saved graph.</li>

<li>
Exit: Exit the Society Monitor.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Window: Bring a window that displays a graph to the foreground.</li>

<li>
Help: Display help information in a browser.</li>
</ul>
All graphs provide the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>
Display Attributes: Double click on a node to display its attributes (this
is the same as selecting the node and then selecting the View-Attributes
menu item). This shows some attributes of the plan object, community, or
agent. The set of attributes displayed is a sub-set of all those possible.
This set may in future be tunable. Feedback on useful current attributes
to show is appreciated.</li>

<li>
Selection: Left click on a node or edge (link between nodes) to select
it. Left hold and drag to select all nodes and edges in an area. Control-left
click to add or remove a node or edge from the selected nodes. Selecting
items in the Overview window causes the main window to scroll to display
the selection. By selecting items in a graph, you may then create a new
graph with that selection, or access certain other relative views.</li>

<li>
Find Node: The Find button in the Attributes table window scrolls the graph
so that the node whose attributes are displayed, is visible.</li>

<li>
Overview: Show an overview of the entire graph. By clicking on the graph,
the main graph window is scrolled to that area.</li>

<li>
Legend: Show a key of the meaning of the different colors and shapes of
the nodes on the graph. See the User's Guide.</li>

<li>
Find: Find a particular node by some criteria. Currently this is very simple,
but will be expanded.</li>

<li>
Filter: Filter the graph to show a sub-graph, using some criteria. Currently
the filtering possibilities are limited. See below, under the Plan View,
for details on how the filtering works.</li>

<li>
Zoom: Zoom in or out on the graph as displayed.</li>

<li>
Save: Any graph or metric may be saved for future analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Graph Menus</b>
<br>These are menus common to all the graph displays:
<ul>
<li>
File:</li>

<ul>
<li>
New With Selection: Create a new graph containing the selected nodes and
their edges.</li>

<li>

to allow the user to specify the file.</li>

<li>
Print...: Print the visible portion of the graph.</li>

<li>
Close: Destroy the view.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Select:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Find...: Select a node by its UID from a list in a pop-up dialog. Highlight
the node and scroll the graph so that the node is displayed. In future
this search capability will be expanded.</li>

<li>
Filter...: Filter plan objects by community and type. Implemented only
for plan object graphs.</li>

<li>
Select All: Select (highlight) all the nodes and links.</li>

<li>

graph.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Overview: Display a "bird's eye view" of the graph. Displays the graph
in a new window, scaled so that all the nodes are visible.</li>

<li>
Attributes: Display the attributes of the selected node in a table in a
new window.</li>

<li>
Legend: Display a legend which describes the colors and shapes used in
the graph.</li>

<li>

<li>
Zoom Out: Zoom out to show less detail.</li>

<li>
Zoom Reset: Reset the zoom level to display the original graph.</li>

<b>Additional Functionality</b>
<br>In addition to the functionality provided by the menus described above,
all graphs provide the following functionality.
<ul>
<li>
Display Attributes: Double click on a node to display its attributes (this
is the same as selecting the node and then selecting the View-Attributes
menu item).</li>

<li>
Selection: Left click on a node or edge (link between nodes) to select
it. Left hold and drag to select all nodes and edges in an area. Control-left
click to add or remove a node or edge from the selected nodes. Selecting
items in the Overview window causes the main window to scroll to display
the selection.</li>

<li>

so that the node whose attributes are displayed, is visible.</li>
</ul>
