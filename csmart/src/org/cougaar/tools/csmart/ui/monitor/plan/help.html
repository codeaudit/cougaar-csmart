<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>

<h3>Society Monitor Plan and Thread View</h3>
The Society Monitor Plan View and Thread View display the contents of the
Blackboard in a running Cougaar society. This document describes functionality
specific to the Plan and Thread display; these displays are the same except
for the manner in which they are launched. The Plan View displays all plan
objects in a society while the Thread View displays plan objects that are
related to a specific plan object. For additional information, common to
all Society Monitor views, select the Help item on the Help menu of the
Society Monitor window.
<p>The Plan View is the most detailed monitoring tool available. It will
potentially return every object in the distributed Cougaar blackboard,
and show you the relationships among each and every such object. For developers,
and for truly understanding a particular interaction or result, this is
the most powerful view.
<p>The Thread View is a filtered version of the Plan View. By selecting
a particular node (usually from a Plan View), you may query up (“Ancestor”)
or down (“Descendant”) its causal chain. This produces a new plan graph,
with only the requested objects.
<br>When viewing an ancestor thread, only parent Tasks are displayed. When
viewing a descendant thread, all objects that can be reached by following
links are displayed.
<p>The Thread view can be used to answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>
How was this Task satisfied?</li>

<li>
Who participated in the solution for this Task?</li>

<li>
What are the requirements associated with this Task?</li>

<li>
Who generated the requirements for this Task?</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Legend</b>
<br>Nodes in the plan view are color coded, according to the agent from
which they were retrieved. Although this means that colors may be re-used,
it does allow the user to quickly identify when processing moves from one
agent to another. For details on which color indicates which agent, view
the legend (from the “View” menu).
<br>Nodes are also different shapes, to indicate different object types.
Again, look at the legend for details.
<br>Note that the plan view is laid out left to right, following the arrows
from Tasks to Plan Elements and on down. These links are solely causal,
and are drawn to minimize link length and crossing, and do not take into
account time or any other factor.
<p>Once the Plan is displayed, you may use it to produce a sub-graph. You
may do this through selection, possibly further filtering your results,
or by producing a Thread Graph from a selected Node, as described above.
<br>In future, this view will support much more complex methods for filtering
and finding, with complex pattern matching and graph abstraction techniques.
Cougaar developers with suggested algorithms are encouraged to submit feedback
on this known-hard problem.
<p>The nodes drawn each represent a different object in the distributed
blackboard of the running society. Objects are color-coded by their source
Agent.
<br>Nodes are linked by edges that represent the flow through the society.
For example, Tasks point to the PlanElement by which they are handled.
See the Legend view to see which shapes indicate which object types.
<p><b>Examine Agent Attributes</b>
<br>For each node in one of the graph views, double-clicking on the node
retrieves a set of attributes for that object. These are a sub-set of the
attributes available from the Blackboard. In future, this set will be tunable.
Currently however, users are requested to submit feedback on desired attributes
to display here. Note that the “Find” button on this window will scroll
the main graph to the appropriate node.
<p><b>Plan View Menus</b>
<br>These are menus specific to the Plan View. For information on menus
and functionality common to all Society Monitor graphs, see the Society
Monitor Help menu.
<ul>
<li>
Select: Filter...See the <a href="#filter">Plan View Filter</a> description
below.</li>

<li>
Show: Parents: Highlight parents (ancestors) of the selected Task nodes
in blue.</li>

<li>
Show: Children: Highlight children (descendants) of the selected Task nodes
in yellow.</li>

<li>
View: Ancestor Thread: Display the ancestors of the selected node in a
new window. Only Task ancestors are displayed.</li>

<li>
View: Descendant Thread: Display the descendants of the selected node in
a new window.</li>
</ul>
<b>Plan View Filter</b>
<br>The&nbsp;<a NAME="filter"></a>Plan View Filter allows the user to filter
out unwanted plan objects. The filter dialog is automatically displayed
when a new Plan View is created. In addition, the Select-Filter menu item
can be used to filter out objects from an existing plan view and create
a new plan view in a new window. Plan Objects can be filtered by Community
(not yet implemented) or by Plan Object Type (Plan Element, Direct Object,
or Workflow). The number of Plan Objects graphed can also be limited.
<p>The Filter implements two concepts of filtering out objects: hiding
objects and ignoring objects. If objects are hidden, the objects are not
graphed, but the transitive closure of the objects' links are graphed;
transitive closures are drawn with bold lines to distinguish them from
normal links. If objects are ignored, neither the objects or their links
are drawn.
