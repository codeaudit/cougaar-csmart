<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>

<h3>Task Completion Graph</h3>
Various run-time metrics may also be displayed from the Society Monitor.
The Task Completion graph is a stacking bar graph that displays information
about Tasks within the society. The displayed Task state is the society
state at the moment the Metrics button is pressed.
<p>The graph displays a bar for each agent within the society.
<br>Each bar consists of 3 sections:
<ul>
<li>
Completed Tasks – This is the total number of Tasks in the agent that have
a high-confidence Allocation Result.</li>

<li>
Total Unallocated Tasks – This is the total number of Tasks that do not
have an associated Plan Element within the agent</li>

<li>
Total Low Confidence Tasks – This is the total number of Tasks with a low
confidence (&lt; 50%) AllocationResult within the agent</li>
</ul>
At any point, the total bar length for the agent displays the total number
of tasks within that agent. Note that bars may shrink during a society
run, due to Tasks being rescinded.
<p><b>Task Metrics Menus</b>
<br>These are menus specific to the Metric Graph View.
<ul>
<li>
File: Save and Save As..... These menu options provide the ability to save
the current metrics graph. The file extension is ".mtr".</li>

<li>
View: Refresh – Allows the ability to redraw the graph based on the current
state of the society.</li>
</ul>
