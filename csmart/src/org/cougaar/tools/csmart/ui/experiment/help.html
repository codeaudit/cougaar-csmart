<h1>Help for the Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h1>

<h2>Experiment Builder</h2>
Use this tool to create an Experiment from a pre-built Society. An Experiment
consists of one or more trials over that Society. 
To add a Society to an Experiment, create the society in the workspace, and
drag it onto the experiment.  When the society is selected in the Experiment
Builder, any unbound properties (properties for which no value was assigned in
the Configuration Builder) will be displayed.
You will then be able
to specify a set of experimental trials varying the values of those properties.
You may also add Recipes to the experiment to modify the behavior of the society in various ways (collect run-time statistics, add simulated behaviors, etc).
To add a recipe to your experiment, create one in your workspace organizer,
and drag it into the appropriate folder here. 
<br>
<b>Metric Recipe Note:</b> 
All built-in societies use the same hard-wired set of metrics. To tune how those
metrics are collected, use the society-specific parameters. 
<br>
Note that all 
changes to your experiment are saved automatically in your workspace, but you should explicitly select File->Save to ensure your changes are saved to the database, when using database societies.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>Societies</h3>
An experiment is currently restricted to include one society. However,
that society may then be varied across one or more dimensions.
<h3>Trials</h3>
Each variation on a society to be run as part of an experiment is a trial.
A trial represents a full specification of one run in an experiment. Thus
it includes a society, specific values for some otherwise un-specified
parameters, the set of recipes to be collected, and the specific
hardware to be used. Associated with a trial may also be some metrics results.
Note that experiments from databases cannot currently be modified to produce
multiple trials.
<h2>Recipes</h2>
An experiment can contain any number of recipes.  Recipes are defined modifications
to a specific society, and will be applied in the order in which they are listed under the Recipes folder.

<h3>Impact Recipes</h3>
Use the Experiment Builder to include a set of simulated external impacts
in your experiment. To do so, create a new ABC Impact in the workspace
organizer, and drag it into the Impacts folder. 
<br>For details on the ABC Impact external impacts, and creating your own
external impacts, see the Users' Guide.
<h3>Metrics Recipes</h3>
Using the Experiment Builder, CSMART users will be able to specify the
exact set of run-time performance measurements which they wish to collect
during their experiment, when to collect them, and from which points in
their society. By metrics, we mean such performance-related statistics
as CPU usage, memory utilization, bandwidth usage, Tasks propagated, etc.
Typically, these statistics come from the core Metrics Service. In future,
they will also come from the QuO run-time kernel service, or other user-specified
sources.
<br>As the society runs, these metrics are typically recorded in results
files (one per agent). Use the <a href="../analyzer/help.html">Performance Analyzer</a> to retrieve these results files for client-side analysis.
As the society runs, periodic statistic snapshots
are collected, and written to a tab separated value text file (one file
per agent). See <a href="../../societies/abcsociety/basic-metric-help.html">Basic Metric Help</a> for detailed metrics collection information.
<br><br>
Additional Impacts and Metrics will be available in a future release.
<h3>Component Recipes</h3>
Component Recipes provide the ability to add a new component to a specific set
of agents within a society.  For more information on Component Recipies,
see the documentation for a specific Component Recipe.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>Using the Experiment Builder</h3>
The following explains usage of each of the tabbed panes:
<h4>Properties</h4>
To edit the tree on the left, create a Society or Recipe in your 
workspace organizer and drag it into the appropriate folder in the tree.
To delete an item in the tree, position the mouse over the item and click the
right mouse button; a pop-up window will be displayed allowing you to delete
the item, or, for a folder, to delete all the items in the folder.
<br>
To edit Unbound Properties in the table, select a Society or Recipe in the tree on the left.  The Unbound Properties (properties for which no value 
was set in the Configuration Builder) are displayed on the right.  Enter a
set of comma separated values to be used in trials.
<br>
Select the Variation Scheme used to generate trials in the experiment.
In the Univariate scheme, the Unbound Properties are varied one at a time;
the default value (assumed to be the first value entered for an Unbound
Property) is used for the non-varied Unbound Properties.  In the Multivariate
scheme, the values of all Unbound Properties are varied at once; this
produces trials for all possible combinations of values of the Unbound Properties.  The "Minimum number of Trials" display indicates how many trials will be automatically produced.
<h4>Configurations</h4>
The configuration of Hosts, Unassigned Nodes, and Unassigned Agents
can be modified using pop-up menus or by drag-and-drop. Agents can be dropped
on nodes; nodes can be dropped on hosts. Create, delete, and rename hosts
and nodes by right clicking on a host or node to display a pop-up menu
with these options. Agents are created by Societies or Recipes and cannot be created,
deleted or renamed in the Experiment Builder. Unassigned Agents are
agents not assigned to a node.

<ol>
<li>
In the Hosts tree, create an entry for each host to be used in the experiment. Note that for database experiments, the hosts defined for the experiment are saved and will re-appear here when others use this experiment. 
An entry for a host can be created:

<ul>
<li>
By adding the host name to the hosts.txt file in the directory from which
CSMART is launched, or</li>

<li>
By clicking the right mouse button over the "Hosts" folder.
A pop-up menu is displayed; select "New Host" from this menu.
A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter the name of the host.</li>

<li>
Note that hosts named "localhost", or host names that do not include the
full domain name (ie cougaar.org), sometimes fail (due to an RMI bug).
The error message:<br>

<pre>!Waiting for //127.0.0.1:8888/NameService!.!.!.</pre>
usually indicates a problem in specifying the host name. Try using an IP address or fully qualified
host name.</li></ul></li>

<li>
Create a node or nodes for each host to be used in the experiment. Note that for database experiments, the full set of Nodes available in the Database is displayed in the unassigned window by default.  Click
the right mouse button over the host folder in the "Hosts" tree, and select
"New Node" from the menu. A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter
the name of the node.</li>

<li>
Assign agents to nodes. Drag and drop agents from the "Unassigned Agents"
tree to the nodes created in the previous step. To select a group of agents,
left click on the first agent to select, and shift left click on the last
agent.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 Using the pop-up menus, additional information can be added to the
 host and node. This information includes: Host Description, Host
 Type, Host Location, Node Description, Global Command Line Arguments,
 and Command Line Arguments. This information can be displayed using
 the Info menu item on the Node menu in the Node window in the
 Experiment Controller.
</p>
<p>
 Some of this information is for the convenience of the user; it does
 not affect running the experiment. The command line arguments,
 however, are passed as -D options and command line arguments to the
 node when it is run and so directly affect how the nodes of the
 society are run. The global command line and command line values both
 affect the running the nodes of the society. Each node receives a
 combination of the global command line values and its own command
 line values. The node command line values override the global ones.
</p>
<h4>Trials</h4>
<p>
This table displays the values that will be used for each of the
Unbound Properties for each trial. To delete a Trial, right click on
the Trial row; a pop-up menu will be displayed allowing you to delete
the Trial.
