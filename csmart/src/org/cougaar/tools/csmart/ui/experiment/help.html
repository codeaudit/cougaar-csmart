<h1>
Help for the Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h1>

<h2>
Experiment Builder</h2>
Use this tool to create an Experiment from a pre-built Society. An Experiment
consists of one or more trials over that Society. By placing a Society
in the Society folder, and selecting it, you should see all of the unbound
properties in the properties panel on the right. You will then be able
to specify a set of experimental trials varying the values of those properties.
(Functionality coming.) You may also add External Impacts to subject the
running society to, or Experimental Metrics to collect. To add an external
impact or metric to your experiment, create one in your workspace organizer,
and drag it into the appropriate folder here. Note however that currently
all societies use the same hard-wired set of metrics. To tune how those
metrics are collected, use the society-specific parameters. Additionally,
the only choice for an Impact with any functionality is the “ABC Impact”
type. This impact only works in part, and cannot effect a society. This
will be possible with the next patch release of Cougaar core, which will
have the necessary Binder support. This impact must be configured by writing
an appropriate format XML file. Note that all changes to your experiment
are saved automatically in your workspace.

<h3>
Societies</h3>
An experiment might potentially include more than one society, if the purpose
is to compare two very different societies in similar settings. Most often
however, a single experiment will include exactly one society. However,
that society may then be varied across one or more dimensions.
<h3>
Trials</h3>
Each variation on a society to be run as part of an experiment is a trial.
A trial represents a full specification of one run in an experiment. Thus
it includes a society, specific values for some otherwise un-specified
parameters, the set of impacts and metrics to be collected, and the specific
hardware to be used. Associated with a trial may also be some metrics results.
<h3>
Impacts</h3>
Use the Experiment Builder to include a set of simulated external impacts
in your experiment. To do so, create a new ABC Impact in the workspace
organizer, and drag it into the Impacts folder. The details of what this
impact will do are specified in the XML file, which the user creates.
<br>For details on the ABC Impact external impacts, and creating your own
external impacts, see the Users' Guide.
<h3>
Metrics</h3>
Using the Experiment Builder, CSMART users will be able to specify the
exact set of run-time performance measurements which they wish to collect
during their experiment, when to collect them, and from which points in
their society. By metrics, we mean such performance-related statistics
as CPU usage, memory utilization, bandwidth usage, Tasks propagated, etc.
Typically, these statistics come from the core Metrics Service. In future,
they will also come from the QuO run-time kernel service, or other user-specified
sources.
<br>As the society runs, these metrics are typically recorded in results
files (one per agent). Use the Performance Analyzer to retrieve these results
files for client-side analysis.
<br>For this release, the societies specify the metrics, which come primarily
from the Metrics Service. Use the Configuration Builder to tune the frequency
of collection. The set of metrics collected is currently identical in each
society, and not yet tunable. As the society runs, periodic statistic snapshots
are collected, and written to a tab separated value text file (one file
per agent). The specific metrics collected are:
<ol>
<li>
Running time of this snapshot (in seconds)</li>

<li>
CPU cycles used by the Node during this snapshot (in seconds). Note that
this metric relies upon the Mylib shared library. If you do not have this
library on your path, it will not be calculated.</li>

<li>
Memory in use by the Node (in megabytes)</li>

<li>
Total memory allocated to the Node (in megabytes)</li>

<li>
Average length of the message queue. Note that this metric, along with
the next two message-transport-related metrics, is currently disabled by
the Message Transport mechanism, pending replacement by more accurate QuO
metrics.</li>

<li>
Message bytes sent during sample.</li>

<li>
Messages sent during sample.</li>

<li>
Tasks completed during this cycle (allocated with a high-confidence AllocationResult).
Note that this does not count metrics-related Tasks.</li>
</ol>
Additional Impacts and Metrics will be available in a future release.
<br>Future releases will support specifying which metrics should be collected
for a given experiment. Currently, all societies record the same metrics.
The details of when the societies record those numbers are controlled from
the Configuration Builder tool.
