<h1>Help for the Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h1>

<h2>Experiment Builder</h2>
Use this tool to create an Experiment from a pre-built Society. An Experiment
consists of one or more trials over that Society. By placing a Society
in the Society folder, and selecting it, you should see all of the unbound
properties in the properties panel on the right. You will then be able
to specify a set of experimental trials varying the values of those properties.
You may also add External Impacts to subject the
running society to, or Experimental Metrics to collect. To add an external
impact or metric to your experiment, create one in your workspace organizer,
and drag it into the appropriate folder here. Note however that currently
all societies use the same hard-wired set of metrics. To tune how those
metrics are collected, use the society-specific parameters. Additionally,
the only choice for an Impact with any functionality is the &quot;ABC Impact&quot;
type. This impact only works in part, and cannot effect a society. This
will be possible with the next patch release of Cougaar core, which will
have the necessary Binder support. This impact must be configured by writing
an appropriate format XML file. Note that all changes to your experiment
are saved automatically in your workspace.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>Societies</h3>
An experiment might potentially include more than one society, if the purpose
is to compare two very different societies in similar settings. Most often
however, a single experiment will include exactly one society. However,
that society may then be varied across one or more dimensions.
<h3>Trials</h3>
Each variation on a society to be run as part of an experiment is a trial.
A trial represents a full specification of one run in an experiment. Thus
it includes a society, specific values for some otherwise un-specified
parameters, the set of impacts and metrics to be collected, and the specific
hardware to be used. Associated with a trial may also be some metrics results.
<h3>Impacts</h3>
Use the Experiment Builder to include a set of simulated external impacts
in your experiment. To do so, create a new ABC Impact in the workspace
organizer, and drag it into the Impacts folder. The details of what this
impact will do are specified in the XML file, which the user creates.
<br>For details on the ABC Impact external impacts, and creating your own
external impacts, see the Users' Guide.
<h3>Metrics</h3>
Using the Experiment Builder, CSMART users will be able to specify the
exact set of run-time performance measurements which they wish to collect
during their experiment, when to collect them, and from which points in
their society. By metrics, we mean such performance-related statistics
as CPU usage, memory utilization, bandwidth usage, Tasks propagated, etc.
Typically, these statistics come from the core Metrics Service. In future,
they will also come from the QuO run-time kernel service, or other user-specified
sources.
<br>As the society runs, these metrics are typically recorded in results
files (one per agent). Use the Performance Analyzer to retrieve these results
files for client-side analysis.
<br>For this release, the societies specify the metrics, which come primarily
from the Metrics Service. Use the Configuration Builder to tune the frequency
of collection. The set of metrics collected is currently identical in each
society, and not yet tunable. As the society runs, periodic statistic snapshots
are collected, and written to a tab separated value text file (one file
per agent). The specific metrics collected are:
<ol>
<li>
Running time of this snapshot (in seconds)</li>

<li>
CPU cycles used by the Node during this snapshot (in seconds). Note that
this metric relies upon the Mylib shared library. If you do not have this
library on your path, it will not be calculated.</li>

<li>
Memory in use by the Node (in megabytes)</li>

<li>
Total memory allocated to the Node (in megabytes)</li>

<li>
Average length of the message queue. Note that this metric, along with
the next two message-transport-related metrics, is currently disabled by
the Message Transport mechanism, pending replacement by more accurate QuO
metrics.</li>

<li>
Message bytes sent during sample.</li>

<li>
Messages sent during sample.</li>

<li>
Tasks completed during this cycle (allocated with a high-confidence AllocationResult).
Note that this does not count metrics-related Tasks.</li>
</ol>
Additional Impacts and Metrics will be available in a future release.
<br>Future releases will support specifying which metrics should be collected
for a given experiment. Currently, all societies record the same metrics.
The details of when the societies record those numbers are controlled from
the Configuration Builder tool.

<h3>Using the Experiment Builder</h3>
The following explains usage of each of the tabbed panes:
<h4>Properties</h4>
To edit the tree on the left, create a Society, Impact or Metric in your 
workspace organizer and drag it into the appropriate folder in the tree.
To delete an item in the tree, position the mouse over the item and click the
right mouse button; a pop-up window will be displayed allowing you to delete
the item, or, for a folder, to delete all the items in the folder.
<br>
To edit Unbound Properties in the table, select a Society, Impact or Metric in the tree on the left.  The Unbound Properties (properties for which no value 
was set in the Configuration Builder) are displayed on the right.  Enter a
set of comma separated values to be used in trials.
<br>
Select the Variation Scheme used to generate trials in the experiment.
In the Univariate scheme, the Unbound Properties are varied one at a time;
the default value (assumed to be the first value entered for an Unbound
Property) is used for the non-varied Unbound Properties.  In the Multivariate
scheme, the values of all Unbound Properties are varied at once; this
produces trials for all possible combinations of values of the Unbound Properties.  The "Minimum number of Trials" display indicates how many trials will be automatically produced.
<h4>Configurations</h4>
The configuration of Hosts, Unassigned Nodes, and Unassigned Agents
can be modified using pop-up menus or by drag-and-drop. Agents can be dropped
on nodes; nodes can be dropped on hosts. Create, delete, and rename hosts
and nodes by right clicking on a host or node to display a pop-up menu
with these options. Agents are created by Societies and cannot be created,
deleted or renamed in the Experiment Builder. Unassigned Agents are
agents not assigned to a node.

<ol>
<li>
In the Hosts tree, create an entry for each host to be used in the experiment.
An entry for a host can be created:

<ul>
<li>
By adding the host name to the hosts.txt file in the directory from which
CSMART is launched, or</li>

<li>
By clicking the right mouse button over the "Hosts" folder.
A pop-up menu is displayed; select "New Host" from this menu.
A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter the name of the host.</li>

<li>
Note that hosts named "localhost", or host names that do not include the
full domain name (ie cougaar.org), sometimes fail (due to an RMI bug).
If you see:<br>

<pre>!Waiting for //127.0.0.1:8888/NameService!.!.!.</pre>
this usually indicates a problem. Try using an IP address or fully qualified
host name.</li></ul></li>

<li>
Create a node or nodes for each host to be used in the experiment. Click
the right mouse button over the host folder in the "Hosts" tree, and select
"New Node" from the menu. A pop-up dialog is displayed in which to enter
the name of the node.</li>

<li>
Assign agents to nodes. Drag and drop agents from the "Unassigned Agents"
tree to the nodes created in the previous step. To select a group of agents,
left click on the first agent to select, and shift left click on the last
agent.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Trials</h4>
This table displays the values that will be used for each of the Unbound 
Properties for each trial.  To delete a Trial, right click on the Trial row;
a pop-up menu will be displayed allowing you to delete the Trial.<br>
