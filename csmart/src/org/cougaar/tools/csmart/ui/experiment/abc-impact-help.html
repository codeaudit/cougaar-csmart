    <h1>Impact Configuration Help</h1>
    The Impact adds an Kinetic or Cyber Impact to the Society.
    <ul>
      <li>Cyber Events            [Integer, 0 - MAX]</li>
      <li>Kinetic Events          [Integer, 0 - MAX]</li>
      <li>Samples Per Second      [String, 0 - 4]</li>
      <li>In Messages Per Second  [String, 0 - ?]</li>
      <li>Out Messages Per Second [String, 0 - ?]</li>
    </ul>

    Currently, there are two types of impacts, Cyber and Kinetic impacts. A typical 
    configuration can have multiple impacts of each type. The amount of impacts in
    a configuration is specified by 'Cyber Events' and 'Kinetic Events'.<br>
    <br>
    A <a href="cyber-impact-help.html>Cyber Impact</a> simulates a cyber event such as a
    denial of service attack on a specific target. <br>
    <br>
    A <a href="kinetic-impact-help.html>Kinetic Impact</a> simulates a real world event such 
    as a flood on a specific target. <br>
    <br>
    'Samples Per Second' specifies how many times per second Messages should be released from 
    the queues.  For example, if this is set to "0.25", then the Messages will only be released 
    from the queues every 4 seconds and would result in "bursts" of I/O every 4 seconds.
    <br><br>
    A good value is "2", which will make the Binder's behavior mostly transparent to the application.  
    The maximum supported value is "4".  This value should not be changed from the default value.
    <br><br>
    'In Messages Per Second'  specifies how many messages can be received by an Agent per second.
    This is used to specify an upper-bound on the Agent's simulated network performance.  
    <br><br>
    For example, "2" would allow at most two messages per second to enter the Agent, with additional 
    messages buffered up.
    <br><br>
    'Out Messages Per Second' specifies how many messages can be send by an Agent per second.
