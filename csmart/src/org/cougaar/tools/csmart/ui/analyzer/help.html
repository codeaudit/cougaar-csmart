<h2>
Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
Thank you for evaluating this prototype!
<h3>
Performance Analyzer</h3>
The Performance Analyzer retrieves Metrics files created by agents during
an experiment and displays those files using data analysis tools (currently,
Microsoft Excel). In future versions, some common analyses may be pre-defined
for the user (perhaps using Excel templates). Once a user has retrieved
metrics results, they are associated with the experiment trial for later
review and comparison (functionality coming).
<p>If Excel does not launch, be sure you have specified the location of
the Excel application in the startup script, (i.e. for Windows, CSMART.bat):
<pre>-Dexcel="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\excel.exe"</pre>
The Performance Analyzer tool is enabled whenenver an experiment is selected
in the Workspace.
<p><b>Retrieving Metrics Files</b>
<br>To retrieve metrics files, select the menu item, File->Retrieve Metrics
Files.... This displays a file chooser for specifying the directory on
the local host in which to store the retrieved files. The Performance Analyzer
retrieves the metrics files from the servers on the hosts listed in the
selected experiment. (The name of the selected experiment is displayed
in the Performance Analyzer window title.) If either of these error messages
is displayed:
<pre>No response from host: hostname; check that server is running.</pre>

<pre>Unknown host: hostname</pre>
ensure that a server is running on each host in the experiment and that
the full host names are correctly entered in the experiment (see the Experiment
Controller help information and the Server installation instructions for
details).
<p><b>Displaying Metrics Files</b>
<br>Use the File–>Open... menu item or click on the “Excel” button to display
a metrics file. If the error message:
<pre>No Metrics Directory for Experiment</pre>
is displayed, first retrieve the metrics files as described above. Note
that the metrics files to be retrieved are defined by the society in the
experiment.
