<h2>Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h2>
<h3>Performance Analyzer</h3>
The Performance Analyzer displays Metrics files created by agents in
an experiment using data analysis tools (currently,
Microsoft Excel or similar application). Metrics files are automatically 
retrieved by the Experiment Controller from the machines on which the experiment was run
at the end of each trial.  The user is queried by the Experiment
Controller to supply a folder or directory in which to store the results.
In future versions, some common analyses may be pre-defined
for the user (perhaps using Excel templates).
<p>If Excel does not launch, be sure you have specified the location of
the Excel application in the startup script, (i.e. for Windows, CSMART.bat):
<pre>-Dorg.cougaar.tools.csmart.excelpath="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\excel.exe"</pre>
<br>
The Performance Analyzer tool is enabled whenever an experiment is selected
in the Workspace.
<p><b>Displaying Metrics Files</b>
<br>Use the File->Open... menu item or click on the "Excel" button to display
a metrics file. If the error message:
<pre>No Metrics Directory for Experiment</pre>
is displayed, then results were not saved for this Experiment.
<p><b>Experiment Results</b>
<br>
Experiment results are stored in the location specified by the user in
the Experiment Controller when the Experiment is first run.  Results are
stored in a hierarchy as follows.  The "Results" folder names are
suffixed with a timestamp of the time that the trial was run.
<ul>
Experiment
<ul>
<li>Trial 1</li>
<ul>
<li>Results-time1</li>
<ul>
<li>Text Files - all files that matched a generous filter for that experiment</li>
</ul>
<li>Results-time2</li>
<ul>
<li>Text Files</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Trial 2</li>
<li>Trial 3</li>
</ul>
</ul>
