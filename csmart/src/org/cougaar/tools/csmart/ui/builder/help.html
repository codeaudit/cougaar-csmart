<h1>Help for the Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting Tool</h1>

<h2>
Configuration Builder</h2>
Use this tool to create a Society, from one of the available templates.
Currently, you may tailor either an ABC Society or a Scalability Society.
In the future, you will be able to specify new Plugins and agents and configure
arbitrary societies. This editor will allow composing and building collections
of components, and importing and exporting sub-collections. This will allow
users to build arbitrary societies.
<p>Components of the society are organized in the tree on the left. Properties
of that component can be edited in the table on the right. Hit escape to
cancel edits to a particular field in progress. Use the society specific
help for details on configuring a particular society. <br>
<br>
<i>Note: Lists are curly-brace enclosed, and comma-separated. Changes to your society are saved automatically in your workspace.</i>

<p>
To set up an experiment, delete the values of the properties that you want to vary in the experiment.  The string "not set" will be displayed for those properties.  These properties are "unbound"; specify the values for these properties in an experiment using the Experiment Builder.
<p>See the help for each of the individual societies for details on configuring
those societies.
