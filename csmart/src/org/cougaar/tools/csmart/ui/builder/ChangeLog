	* PropertyTable.java:
	Use combo box based cell editor whenever the value is a set of
	single-valued ranges. For example, if the allowed values are the
	names of recipe queries, they can be selected from the combobox
	precluding entry of unknown queries.

	* PropertyTable.java:
	When property value validation fails (throws an exception) present
	the user with an error dialog instead of a stack trace on the
	stdout. The error dialog shows the allowed ranges and allows the
	selection of an single-valued range as a replacement. Ideally, the
	GUI would have presented the values this way in the first place.

	* PropertyBuilder.java (Repository):
	Add "Save To Database" menu item and code for saving edited
	recipes. This code current is duplicated in Organizer. It should
	be abstracted into a separate class.
