<h1>CSMART Society Configuration Help</h1>
<p>CSMART societies contain Agents, and the contents of Agents. For
higher-level components, or to add to the contents of NodeAgents,
please use Recipes.
<p>Within this tool, you may add Agents. Note however that such Agents
will not have any Oplan related information in the database, if that
is important.
<p>Within an Agent, there are 4 Categories in which you may add
components: Plugins, Binders (of Plugins), Other Components (whose
insertion point falls within the Agent), and Asset Data (ie Entity or
Organization Assets).
<p>To add an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the Society folder.
<p>To remove an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the Agent folder.
<p>To add a Plugin, Binder, or Other Component, use the pop-up menu on
that folder. The drop-down lists of components are editable, and are
populated from the list of Plugins / Binders currently in use in your society.
<p>To edit a parameter in your Asset, edit the values in the right pane.
Within an Asset, you may add Relationships or
PropertyGroups. For each case, to add another one, use the
corresponding pop-up menu.
<p>To add a Parameter to or remove a Plugin, Binder, or Other
Component, use the pop-up menu on that component. When adding
parameters to these components, parameters are automatically named so
that they will be added at runtime in the order in which you add them
here, named "param-0", "param-1", etc.
<p>When adding parameters to PropertyGroups,
you will be asked for a parameter name. Note that the names of
parameters of Property Groups include the type of Object used to fill
in that value. For example, OrganizationPG has one Parameter, whose name is:<br>
Roles (Role)<br>
and whose value is a list, something like "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider". This means that the slot in
the PropertyGroup is called "Roles", and the Java Class of each object
is "Role". In this case, there are many values, so the slot contains a
Collection.<br>
The "INI" equivalent lines would be something like:<br>
<pre>[OrganizationPG]
Roles                    Collection&lt;Role&gt;       "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider"
</pre><br>
<b>Spelling errors, referring to a non-existent field
or Property Group, or other errors will not be noticed until runtime.</b>
<p>To remove a parameter, use the pop-up menu on that parameter. Note
that the remaining parameters will continue to be added according to
the numbers given in their names.
<p>Times should be specified in a standard Java parsable format, eg:
MM/DD/YY HH:MI AM.
<p>Elements in a collection should be separated by a comma and a space.
<p>Components within agents now have a <tt>Priority</tt> field.  The priority
indicates the load priority of the component in it's container relative to
other children components loaded at the same time at the same containment point.

The default component priority is: <tt>COMPONENT</tt>
