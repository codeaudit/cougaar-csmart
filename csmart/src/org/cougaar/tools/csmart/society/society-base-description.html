<h1>CSMART Society</h1>
<p>
CSMART Societies contain Agents, Binders in Agents, Plugins, etc.
They may be edited within this tool, and added to Experiments
for running. Use Recipes to add components to the Node Agent or
to add Binders of Agents. Societies are created from the database,
from files, or from this Configuration Builder UI. Edit the society
using the pop-up menus on various items in the tree on the left, and
then editing values of fields in the table on the right.<br>
All entries are integers or Strings, or occasionaly curly-brace enclosed and comma-separated lists of Strings.
