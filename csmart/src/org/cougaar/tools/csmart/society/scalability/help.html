<p>
<p>The Scalability Society in CSMART is the scalability module used at
the last ALP workshop to measure the scalability of the Cougaar architecture.
It allows you to create societies of a rigidly controlled structure, and
collect run-time statistics on the running of the society. The specific
collected metrics are detailed elsewhere. For details on the purpose of
the scalability society, see <a href="http://www.cougaar.org/projects/scalability.html">Cougaar Scalability</a>.
Here, we provide an overview on how to construct a scalability society.
<p>The scalability society consists of a number of different levels. There
are a number of agents at each level. Levels are numbered from 0 up. Tasks
originate at level 0 and flow to the next higher level. At each level,
the incoming Tasks are expanded into a number of <a href="#subtask">subtasks</a>.
The subtasks are “processed” by a consumption Plugin that consumes CPU
and memory resources for each Task. The consumption Plugin then expands
the Task into a <a href="#consumed">consumed subtask</a>. This consumed
subtask is then allocated to either a local Asset or to one of the agents
at the next higher level.
<p>All properties are either single integers or arrays of integers. For
properties that have array values, each element of the array corresponds
to the value use for the corresponding level: the 0<sup>th</sup> element
for level zero, the 1<sup>st</sup> element for level one and so on. Extra
elements are ignored. When an array is shorter than the number of levels,
its final element is duplicated as needed. In some cases, the first or
last element is ignored to insure the correctness of the society. For example,
there must be no org allocators at the last level because there are no
levels beyond the last.
<p>A number of properties control the structure of the society:

<a NAME="agentbytes"></a><h3>Agent Bytes Per Task</h3> 
Specifies the size (in bytes) of a block of memory that is allocated for each task. The
memory is held in the agent for as long as the task exists. It is discarded
when the task is removed.


<a NAME="agentcount"></a><h3>Agent Count by Level</h3>
Specifies the number of total Agents in each level of your society. The Agent count for
level 0 should always be 1.

<a NAME="assetcount"></a><h3>Asset Count by Level</h3>
Specifies the number of total Assets in each level of your society. Used to stress the
load of the system.

<a NAME="cpu"></a><h3>CPU Per Task</h3>
The number of times a loop that does an integer divide should be performed. The value is expressed in tens
of thousands of iterations.

<a NAME="expansion"></a><h3>Expansion</h3>
An array of integers specifying the number of <a href="#subtask">subtasks</a> created 
for each incoming task.

<a NAME="leafallocators"></a><h3>Leaf Allocator Count</h3>
Specifies the number of leaf allocators in an agent. Each leaf allocator allocates
<a href="#consumed">consumed subtasks</a> to local assets. A given allocator handles every nth task
where "n" is the total number of allocators (both leaf allocators and org
allocators). Usually the last level should have at least one Leaf Allocator,
to ensure that all Tasks are handled.

<a NAME="levelcount"></a><h3>Level Count</h3>
An integer that specifies the number of levels

<a NAME="msgbytes"></a><h3>Message Bytes Per Task</h3>
Specifies the additional memory added to every task in an agent. This memory is not cumulative.
Every subtask created in an agent is encumbered with a block of memory
of the specified size. This memory consumes memory resources, but is intended
to consume communication bandwidth.

<a NAME="orgallocators"></a><h3>Org Allocator Count</h3>
Specifies the number of org allocators in an agent. Each Org Allocator allocates consumed
subtasks to all of the agents at the next level. Again, a given allocator
handles every nth task where "n" is the total number of allocators (both
leaf allocators and org allocators). The plugin allocates to the agents
at the next level in round robin fashion. Usually, each level in your society
should have at least one Org Allocator, to ensure that Tasks are propagated
to the next level. The last level should not have an Org Allocator, as
there is no next level.

<a NAME="subscriptioncount"></a><h3>Subscription Count</h3> 
Specifies the total subscriptions in an agent. A dummy plugin is added to create
additional subscriptions depending on the number of subscriptions needed
by the rest of the plugins in the agent.

<br><br><br><br>
Other properties control the size of the experiment and other aspects of
the load imposed by the problem:

<a NAME="roottasks"></a><h3>Root Tasks</h3>
Specifies how many tasks are created to start things off. Each of these root tasks 
is expanded and allocated as described above. The trial ends when all root tasks have been created
and completely expanded and allocated.

<a NAME="queuetasks"></a><h3>Queue Tasks</h3>
Specifies how many root tasks are
created at a time. Initially, a number of root tasks is created as specified
by this value. As expansion and allocation of these tasks completes, additional
root tasks are created to maintain a level of unfinished tasks at the specified
level. A value of zero means to create all the root tasks at once.

<a NAME="rescindlevel"></a><h3>Rescind Level</h3>
Specifies how many completed root tasks are retained. Zero means retain all root tasks. 
Otherwise, root tasks are rescinded to maintain the number of completed tasks at the specified
level.

<a NAME="taskrate"></a><h3>Task Rate</h3> 
Specifies the interval (in tasks per
minute) between the creation of root tasks.

<a NAME="samplelevel"></a><h3>Sample Interval</h3>
Specifies how long (in seconds)
to wait between samples. Zero means to only take a sample at the end of
the trial.


<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p><a NAME="subtask"></a><b>Subtask</b> -- in this context, an unqualified "subtask"
is a task created by the ScalabilityExpanderPlugIn when it expands a root
task or a task received from another agent.
<p><a NAME="consumed"></a><b>Consumed Subtask</b> -- The ConsumerPlugIn expands
a subtask into a consumed subtask after consuming the specified resources.
