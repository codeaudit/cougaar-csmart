<h1>ABC Society Configuration Help</h1>

<p>The ABC Society uses abstract domain plugins to generate an
arbitrarily large and complex society, which behaves like a logistics
supply chain.
<br><br>
The Society is organized by Communities, which pass Tasks between
them. Each community consists of four Agents: Customer1, Customer2, Provider1 and Provider2.
<br><br>
Customer 1 and Customer 2 Agents periodically inject new demand Tasks into the system. 
Provider 1 and Provider 2 Agents supplies local assets for these tasks.  When tasks
are submitted, Provider1 attempts to satisify them with some local asset capacity. If that Agent
cannot fulfill the requests, they are then allocated to the Provider2 Agent within that community.
<br><br>
If the Provider2 cannot fulfill the task locally, it allocates the task to the
Provider2 Agent in another Community, depending on how the supply relationships have been established.
<br><br>
This society works in a purely execution mode: all tasks are matched against assets, and 
responses are always given with high confidence eventually. In particular, Tasks include 
deadlines for completion, and often requests will fail due to an exceeded deadline.
<br><br>
To build an ABC Society, you can specify parameters at several
different levels. <br>
<i>Note: that all parameters have defaults, so that modifications at all levels are not required.</i>
<br>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
You may edit parameters at the following levels:<ul>
<li><a href="#soclevel">Society Level</a><br>
Overall control parameters.</li>

    <br><br>

An ABC Society consists of one or more communities which in turn contain 4 agents 
(2 Customer and 2 Provider Agents).  
A society attempts to maintain a basic hourglass topology of communities by dividing 
the communities among levels.  
By default, there are 5 communities and three levels.<br>
This results in the following topology:
<br><br>
<div align="center">
<table>
<tr><td>Community 1</td> <td></td> <td>Community 2</td> </tr>
<tr><td></td> <td>Community 3</td> <td></td> </tr>
<tr><td>Community 4</td> <td></td> <td>Community 5</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<br>
Changing the <a href="#COMMUNITY_COUNT">Community Count</a> or changing the <a href="#LEVEL_COUNT">Level Count</a>
will regenerate a new community with an attempt to preserve the hourglass topology.
<br><br>
<i>Note: There must always be at least as many communities as levels.</i>
<br><br>
There are two types of agents within a society.  Customer agents and Provider 
agents.  Customer agents produce tasks and provider agents contain the assets 
to satisfy the task request.  Tasks are submitted between <a href="#START_TIME">Start Time</a> and 
<a href="#STOP_TIME">Stop Time</a>.  Tasks start getting generated at Start Time + current time 
and continue until Stop Time + current time.  
<br>

<a NAME="COMMUNITY_COUNT"><h3>Community Count</h3></a>
Community Count specifies the total number of communities within the society.

<a NAME="LEVEL_COUNT"><h3>Level Count</h3></a>
Level Count Specifies the total number of levels within the society.  The ABC
Society attempts to maintain an hour glass topology where there are fewer communities
at the inner levels than there are at the ends.

<a NAME="START_TIME"><h3>Start Time</h3></a>
Start Time specifies the relative starting time in milliseconds.  When
the current time equals the start time, Customer Agents start to submit
tasks for completion.

<a NAME="STOP_TIME"><h3>Stop Time</h3></a>
Stop Time specifies the relative stop time in milliseconds.  When
the current time equals the stop time, Customer Agents stop submitting
tasks.<br>
<i>Note: Stop time does not indicate that all agent communications stop,
Provider Agents will continue to satisify all outstanding tasks beyond
stop time.</i>

<a NAME="TASK_VERB"><h3>Task Verb</h3></a>
Task Verb indicates the Known tasks within the society.  Since
the society can contain multiple task verbs, they must be specified
as an array of strings.
<i>Note: See Known issues for more information about Task Verb</i>

<a NAME="commlevel"><h2>Community Level</h2></a>

The community level specifies all parameters that are specific to
communities.  

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">
	<tr>
	  <td><b>Name</b></td>
	  <td><b>Type</b></td>
	  <td><b>Range</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#DEMAND">Demand</a></td>
	  <td>Integer</td>
	  <td>0 - MAX</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#LATITUDE">Latitude</a></td>
	  <td>Float</td>
	  <td>-90 - 90</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#LONGITUDE">Longitude</a></td>
	  <td>Float</td>
	  <td>-180 - 180</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#PRODUCTION">Production</a></td>
	  <td>Integer</td>
	  <td>0 - MAX</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

Each community has a specific amount of production and demand associated with it.  
The <a href="#DEMAND">demand</a> is proportional to the number of tasks produced by the Customer agents
within the community.  The higher the demand, the more tasks produced.  <a href="#PRODUCTION">Production</a> is 
proportional to the amount of inventory on hand in the community.  Producer agents that contain a local 
inventory satisfy all Tasks until their inventory is depleted.  Once the inventory is delpeted, 
the Task must be satisified elsewhere, until the local inventory has been re-supplied.  
Increasing the amount of Production in a community increases the local inventory levels, which 
will eliminate the need for tasks to be satisfied by other communities.
<br>
Each community also has a location associated with it.  This location 
specified with <a href="#LATITUDE">Latitude</a> and <a href="#LONGITUDE">Longitude</a> is the 
center of the community.  All agent locations are based on the center of the community.
<br>

<a NAME="DEMAND"><h3>Demand</h3></a>
Demand is used to generate the number of tasks produced by the Customer agents.  The
higher the demand, the more tasks that are produced.<br>
<i>Note: Demand is part of a formula, not an exact task count -- A Demand of 5 does not equal 5 tasks.</i>

<a NAME="LATITUDE"><h3>Latitude</h3></a>
Latitude specifies the Latitude coordinate of the center of the community.

<a NAME="LONGITUDE"><h3>Longitude</h3></a>
Longitude specifies the Longitude coordinate of the center of the community.

<a NAME="PRODUCTION"><h3>Production</h3></a>
Production is used to generate the amount of inventory on hand within the community. The higher
the production value, the more local assets within the community.<br>
<i>Note: Production is part of a formula, not an exact inventory level count</i>

<a NAME="agentlevel"><h2>Agent Level</h2></a>

The Agent level specifies all parameters that are specific to an agent.

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">

	  <td>{<i>Supply [,Supply..]</i>}</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

All agents are located relative to the center of the community.  This location
is specified with the <a href="#DIRECTION">direction</a> and 
<a href="#DISTANCE">distance</a> parameters.
All agents that contain local assets (Provider Agents) must also specify a
list of the agents that this agents <a href="#SUPPLIES">supplies</a> assets.
<br>
<a NAME="DIRECTION"><h3>Direction</h3></a>
Direction specifies the direction, in degrees from North, of the agent
from the center of the community.

<a NAME="DISTANCE"><h3>Distance</h3></a>
Distance specifies the distance, in meters of the agent from the center
of the community.

<a NAME="SUPPLIES"><h3>Supplies</h3></a>
Supplies specifies a list of all agents, fully qualified names, that this agent
serves as a provider. <br>
<i>Note: This parameter is left empty for Customer agents since they do not contain local assets.</i>

<a NAME="alloclevel"><h2>The Allocation Level</h2></a>

The allocation level specifies all parameters that are specific to an allocation.

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">

	  <td>Long</td>
	  <td>0 - MAX</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

All agents have an allocation table.  This table is used to allocate all the 
known tasks for this agent.   The Allocator can trys to calculate reduced Task 
deadlines, based on estimated times. By asking downstream components to complete 
a Task within reduced times, the Allocator hopes to have sufficient time to send 
a response the original customer, or perhaps attempt another Allocation if this one fails. 
<br>

<a NAME="EXEC_TIME"><h3>Execute Time</h3></a>
Estimated Execute Time specifies the estimated time, in milliseconds, that it will take to 
satisify the task once it is allocated to an actual asset.

<a NAME="ALLOC_RULES"><h3>Number of Allocation Rules</h3></a>
Number of Allocation Rules specifies the amount of allocation rules within an allocation table.
When a new rule is added to the allocation table (by incrementing the number) they are added as
empty rules.  The CSMART user is required to fill in the <a href="#TASK_ROLE">Roles</a> and 
<a href="#R_TASK_VERB">Task Verb</a> for each new rule.

<a NAME="PUB_TIME"><h3>Publish Time</h3></a>
Allocation Publish Time specifies the time, in milliseconds, that it takes the allocator to publish 
an allocation.

<a NAME="RES_TIME"><h3>Response Time</h3></a>
Response Publish Time specifies the time, in milliseconds, that it takes the allocator to publish
a simple response.

<a NAME="ALLOC_CONFIDENCE"><h3>Successful Allocation</h3></a>
Allocation Confidence Required specifies the condidence level of received allocation results. <br>
0 - Indicates that all allocatoin results will be considered confident.<br>
1 - Indicates that only allocations that specify complete confidence will be accepted.

<a NAME="EST_TRANS_TIME"><h3>Transport Time</h3></a>
Estimated Transport time specifies the time, in milliseconds, that it takes for the allocator to
transport the allocation to the remote agent.


<a NAME="rulelevel"><h2>The Rule Level</h2></a>

The Rule Level specifies all parameters that are specific to an allocation rule.

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">

	  <td><a href="#R_TASK_VERB">Task Verb</a></td>
	  <td>String</td>
	  <td></td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

All agents can have multiple allocation rules.<br>
Each rule consists of a <a href="#R_TASK_VERB">Task Verb</a> to allocate and a list 
of the <a href="#TASK_ROLE">Roles</a> required of an Asset to be
able to allocate this Task verb to it (all listed rules must be present). 
Multiple rules for the same task verb are permissible. Later
rules will usually be for less dependable, or increasingly remote
Assets or Organizations.
<br>

<a NAME="TASK_ROLE"><h3>Roles</h3></a>
Roles specifies a list of Roles associated with this allocations <a href="#R_TASK_VERB">Task verb</a>.
 
<a NAME="R_TASK_VERB"><h3>Task Verb</h3></a>
Task Verb specifies a specific Task within the allocation table.  This task must be know
throughout the society.
<i>Note: See Known Issues for more information about the Task Verb</i>

<a NAME="tasklevel"><h2>The Tasks Level</h2></a>

The Tasks level specifies all parameters that are specific to the task level:

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">
	<tr>
	  <td><b>Name</b></td>
	  <td><b>Type</b></td>
	  <td><b>Range</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#NUMB_TASKS">Number of Tasks</a></td>
	  <td>Long</td>
	  <td>0 - MAX</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

The <a href="#NUMB_TASKS">Number of Tasks</a> specifies the number of tasks known to this agent.  
Changing this number increments the number of tasks within the task file.  When new 
<a href="#taskchild">tasks</a> are added, it is the responsiblity of the CSMART user to 
add a <a href="#TC_VERB">Task Verb</a> to the newly created task.  By default, the 
<b>Task Verb</b> is empty. 
<br>

<a NAME="NUMB_TASKS"><h3>Number of Tasks</h3></a>
Number of Tasks specifies the number of tasks known to a specific agent.

<a name="taskchild"><h2>Task Children</h2></a>

The Task level contains 1 or more children.
Each child represents a specific task verb that agent should generate.<br>
<i>Note: Only Customer agents generate Tasks.</i>  
<br><br>

Each task consists of the following properties:

    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">
	<tr>
	  <td><b>Name</b></td>
	  <td><b>Type</b></td>
	  <td><b>Range</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#CHAOS_FACTOR">Chaos Factor</a></td>

	  <td>Float</td>
	  <td>0 - 1</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

When the customer agent is started, it starts to submit a <a href="#TC_VERB">task verb</a> to 
be satisfied.  Tasks are repeatedly submitted at a specified <a href="#INTERVAL">Interval</a> 
from the start time until the stop time of the society.  Some amount of 
variability can be applied to the Interval by increasing the <a href="#CHAOS_FACTOR">Chaos Factor</a>
for the task.  Each task must be completed by a specific time.  This time is 
specified with <a href="#DEADLINE">Deadline</a>.  If the task is not completed 
by the deadline, the customer's overall happiness will decrease.  The amount 
this value decreases for each unsuccessful task is controlled by the <a href="#VITALNESS">Vitalness 
Factor</a>.
<br>

<a NAME="CHAOS_FACTOR"><h3>Chaos Factor</h3></a>
Chaos Factor is the amount of variablilty in the task interval.  The larger the Chaos Factor,
the more variablilty in the interval.

<a NAME="DEADLINE"><h3>Deadline</h3></a>
Deadline is the amount of time, in milliseconds, after the task has be submitted by which it must be completed.

<a NAME="INTERVAL"><h3>Interval</h3></a>
The Interval is the amount of time, in milliseconds,  between tasks.

<a NAME="TC_VERB"><h3>Task Verb</h3></a>
The Task Verb is the task to be satisified.

<a NAME="VITALNESS"><h3>Vitalness</h3></a>
The Vitalness indicates how vital completion of a task is to overall agent happiness.
The higher the vitalness, the unhappier the agent becomes if the task fails.


<a NAME="locassetlevel"><h2>The Local Asset Level</h2></a>

The local asset level has the following properties:
    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">
	<tr>
	  <td><b>Name</b></td>
	  <td><b>Type</b></td>
	  <td><b>Range</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#ASSET_NAME">Asset Name</a></td>
	  <td>String</td>

	  <td>Long</td>
	  <td>0 - MAX</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>


Every provider agent contains a local asset.  This asset is used to satisfy 
task requests.  Every asset contains an inventory level. When the asset is used to satisfy a task 
request, the inventory level decreases.  The decrement amount for each Task 
completion depends on the <a href="#INV_DEC_PCT">Decrement Amount</a> parameter.
The inventory level can also have a certain amount of chaos applied to it by 
changing the <a href="#INV_DEC_DEV">Inventory Deviation</a> parameter (for 
example, stock loss due to fire or theft).  This chaotic inventory perturbation is 
applied before every inventory request.  Each local asset can satisfy specific 
<a href="#LA_ROLES">roles</a>.<br>
<i>Note: An asset must list all of the roles required of it by the Allocation Rules above for it to be used for a given task verb.</i>

<br><br>
When an asset is used to satisfy a task, it takes a specific amount of <a href="#AVG_EXEC_TIME">time</a> to complete the task request.  By adjusting the <a href="#TIME_DEV">Time Deviation</a> value, 
the time taken to satisfy a Task will vary randomly.
<br>

<a NAME="ASSET_NAME"><h3>Asset Name</h3></a>
Asset Name is the name of the Local Asset.  Asset Name is just an
identifier and is not used within the system.

<a NAME="AVG_EXEC_TIME"><h3>Average Execute Time</h3></a>
Average Execute Time is the average amount of time it takes to perform a specific task.
Average Execute Time also controls how rapibly the local stock is refilled after a request.

<a NAME="INV_DEC_PCT"><h3>Inventory Decrement Percent</h3></a>
Inventory Decrement Percent defines the decrement amount for each task completion.
The larger the decrement amount, the quicker the inventory can be depleted.

<a NAME="INV_DEC_DEV"><h3>Inventory Decrement Deviation</h3></a>
Inventory Decrement Deviation causes the inventory decrement rate to vary randomly.  The
larger the value, the more variable the decrement rate.  With an 'Inventory Deviation' of 0, 
the reported inventory level is the exactly calculable from the previous requests of that asset.

<a NAME="LA_ROLES"><h3>Roles</h3></a>
Roles is a list of roles that this asset can satisfy.

<a NAME="TIME_DEV"><h3>Time Deviation</h3></a>
Time Deviation causes the time taken to satisfy a task to vary randomly (Gaussian).  The
larger the value, the more variable the time.
