	* ScalabilityXLevel.java (Repository):
	Repeat properties to all agents otherwise the first agent is the
	only one with the correct values.

	* ScalabilityXSociety.java (Repository):
	Fix MirroredPropertyInfo. The value of a mirrored property was not
	being saved. In fact, the property values sent to new levels was
	always from the agentCount array. Majorly broken.

	* ScalabilityXPlugIn.java (Repository): 
	Use new addInvisibleProperty methods for parameters. This are all
	created and manipulated by the agent component and should not be
	otherwise invisible.
