<h1>Basic Metric Configuration Help</h1>
The Basic Metric collects rudimentary run-time performance metrics for any society to which it is added. The results can then be viewed in the <a href="../../ui/analyzer/help.html">Performance Analyzer.</a><br>

Throughout task production, metrics are collected for each agent.  Once the 
agent is started, it will start producing metrics at <a href="#START_DELAY">Start Delay</a> + 
current time.  The agent will then continue to report its metrics at every 
interval <a href="#SAMPLE_INTERVAL">Sample Interval</a> until the requested number 
of metrics samples <a href="#MAX_SAMPLES">Maximum Number of Samples</a> are collected.<br>
<br>
Metrics contain some standard statistics that are always collected. These include:

<h3>Sample Length in Seconds</h3>
This statistic is the CPU seconds used by the Node during a sample.<br>
<i>Note: This CPU statistic requires the separate CpuClock shared library, included
with the scalability module.   See the Scalability module's install
instructions for installing the CpuClock library. If you do not install
this library, you will see a warning exception, which can be ignored.</i><br>

<h3>Memory used by Node in Megabytes</h3>
This statistic indicates the total memory allocated to the Node in megabytes.<br>
<br>
 
<h2>Option Metrics and Parameters</h2>
The remaining parameters allow you to customize metrics collection and which metrics are collected.

<a name="MAX_SAMPLES"><h3>Max Number of Metric Samples</h3></a>
The maximum number of metrics samples to collect.

<a name="SAMPLE_INTERVAL"><h3>Metric Sample Interval</h3></a>
Specifies the interval, in seconds,  that metric samples are collected.  The first metric is collected
at current time + <a href="#START_DELAY">Start Delay</a> and subsequent metrics
are collected at every interval until the maximum number of samples are collected or
the society stops running.

<a name="START_DELAY"><h3>Start Delay</h3></a>
Start delay specifies a delay, in seconds, before metrics collection start.  

<a name="TASK_VERB"><h3>Task Verb</h3></a>
The Task Verb parameter allows you to request that the plugin count the tasks with the 
given Verb that go by.
<br>
It will also count the time since the first task with that Verb went by.
<br>
For example, use this to count the Transport tasks, or to see how long
after a Determine Requirements Task things get busy.
<br><br>
Setting the task verb adds three new statistics: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Time since first Task with the Verb</li>
  <li>Number of Tasks in this interval with the verb</li>
  <li>Total Tasks seen with the verb</li>
</ul>
<i>Note:  See know issues for more information on Task Verb</i>


The following parameters indicate various services that contain statistics. Collection
of these statistics can be turned on/off by setting the value of the parameter.
<b>Default is: off</b> for all services
<br>
<a name="BLACKBOARD_STATS"><h3>Blackboard Statistics Service</h3></a>
Turning on Blackboard statistics adds:
<ul>
  <li>Count of Assets on this Agent's Blackboard</li>
  <li>Plan Elements on this Blackboard</li>
  <li>Tasks on the Blackboard</li>
  <li>Total Objects on this Blackboard</li>
</ul>

<a name="PROTOTYPE_REGISTRY"><h3>Prototype Registry Service</h3></a>
<ul>
  <li>Cached Prototypes</li>
  <li>Property Providers</li>
  <li>Prototype Providers</li>
</ul>
<a name="NODE_METRICS"><h3>Node Metrics Service</h3></a>
Active threads in the COUGAAR group (a per-Node stat)<br>
Free memory (bytes) in this Node's allocation<br>
Total memory (bytes) in this Node's allocation<br>


The remaining statistics are recorded only if the MessageStatisticsService was requested.
<b>Default is: On</b>
<br>

<a name="MSG_STATS"><h3>Message Stats Service</h3></a>
Message Queue Length (a per-Node statistic)<br>
MessageBytes Sent (per-Node)<br>
Messages sent (per-Node)<br>

<a name="MSG_WATCH"><h3>Message Watcher Service</h3></a>
Directives received by this Agent<br>
Directives sent<br>
Notifications received by this Agent<br>
