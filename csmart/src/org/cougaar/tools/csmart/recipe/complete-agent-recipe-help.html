<h1>Complete Agent Recipe Configuration Help</h1>
The Complete Agent Recipe allows users to create an arbitrary agent
for inclusion in a society. Note however that added agents will not
have any Oplan related information in the database.
<br>
<i>Note: The agents do not contain an OrgAsset by default.  This will
result in the agent not being visible from the Society Monitor.  If
a OrgAsset is added, be sure to add the OrgData
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgDataPlugin</code>) and
OrgReport
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgReportPlugin</code>)
plugins, and include a ClusterPG, ItemIdentificationPG, and
TypeIdentificationPG on your Asset. See below.</i>
<br>
<p>Within an Agent, there are 4 Categories in which you may add
components: Plugins, Binders (of Plugins), Other Components (whose
insertion point falls within the Agent), and Asset Data (ie Entity or
Organization Assets).

<p>To add an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the top-level folder.
<p>To remove an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the Agent folder.
<p>To add a Plugin, Binder, or Other Component, use the pop-up menu on
that folder. The drop-down lists of components are editable, and are
populated from the list of Plugins / Binders currently known in the
database.
<p>Components within agents now have a <tt>Priority</tt> field.  The
priority indicates the load priority of the component in it's
container relative to other children components loaded at the same
time at the same containment point. 

The default component priority is: <tt>COMPONENT</tt>, and for Binders
it should usually be <tt>BINDER</tt>.

<p>To edit a parameter in your Asset, edit the values in the right pane.
Within an Asset, you may add Relationships or
PropertyGroups. For each case, to add another one, use the
corresponding pop-up menu.
<p>To add a Parameter to or remove a Plugin, Binder, or Other
Component, use the pop-up menu on that component. When adding
parameters to these components, parameters are automatically named so
that they will be added at runtime in the order in which you add them
here, named "param-0", "param-1", etc.
<br>
<b>General Editing</b>
<i>To specify multiple values for a parameter, you
<b>must</b> enclose the list of comma-separated values in curly-braces
or square brackets.</i><br>
<b>Spelling errors, referring to a non-existent field
or Property Group, or other errors will not be noticed until runtime.</b>
<p>To remove a parameter, use the pop-up menu on that parameter. Note
that the remaining parameters will continue to be added according to
the numbers given in their names.
<p>Times should be specified in a standard Java parsable format, eg:
MM/DD/YY HH:MI AM.
<p>Elements in a collection should be separated by a comma and a
space, and the entire list enclosed by curly-braces or square brackets.
<br><br>

<b>AssetData</b>
<p>When adding parameters to PropertyGroups, you will be asked for a
parameter name and a type (Java class). Note that the names of
parameters of Property Groups, once displayed, include the type of
Object used to fill in that value. For example, OrganizationPG has one
Parameter, whose name is:<br> 
Roles (Role)<br>
and whose value is a list, something like "{TransportationProvider,
StrategicTransportationProvider}". This means that the slot in 
the PropertyGroup is called "Roles", and the Java Class of each object
is "Role". In this case, there are many values enclosed in curly
braces or square brackets, so the slot contains a
Collection. 
The "INI" equivalent lines would be something like:<br>
<pre>[OrganizationPG]
Roles   Collection&lt;Role&gt;  "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider"
</pre>

<h2>Adding an Agent Asset</h2>

To have a working organization when doing an agent asset addition, you
must include the following:  

<h3>Asset Class</h3>
Something like "Military Organization". Be sure the default asset
class is correct, edit as needed. 

<h3>Unique Id</h3>
Be sure the Unique Id is correct, edit as needed.

<h3> Property Groups: </h3>
The following must be added:<br><br>

<b>TypeIdentificationPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>TypeIdentification String <i>(value usually the UTC of the
agent)</i></b><br> 
* <b>Nomenclature String <i>(optional)</i></b><br>
* <b>AlternateTypeIdentification String <i>(optional)</i></b><br>

<br>
<b>ClusterPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>ClusterIdentifier ClusterIdentifier <i>AgentName</i></b><br>

<br>
<b>ItemIdentificationPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>ItemIdentification String <i>AgentName</i></b><br>
* <b>Nomenclature String <i>(optional)</i></b>

<br><br>
<b>Org related Plugins</b><br>
You must also include the 2 org-related Plugins for your OrgAsset 
(Asset Data) to be loaded at runtime. 
These are the OrgData
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgDataPlugin</code>) and 
OrgReport 
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgReportPlugin</code>) 
Plugins (which take no arguments).<br>
