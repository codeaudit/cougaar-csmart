<h1>Servlet Group Insertion Recipe Configuration Help</h1>
<p>The Servlet Group Insertion Recipe allows users to select groups of
individual servlets from the list of available servlets below.  Two
versions of this recipe have been pre-configured and included in the
CSMART configuration database. One that will include all basic
servlets (set all the Servlet values to 'True') in all Agents (via the
appropriate query) is included in all experiments by default.  There
is also a second which includes only the CSMART Society Monitor
servlets.</p>
 <br>
<p>These servlets can be added to individual agents as appropriate or to 
all agents based on the query selected by the user. The target query 
comes from the file <tt>PopulateDb.q</tt> or the user created file 
<tt>recipeQueries.q</tt>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Note:</b><i> Adding additional servlets is no longer possible using this
recipe.  Please use the specific insertion recipe to add new servlets.</i></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<a name="SERVLET"><h3>Servlet</h3></a>
Specifies whether the particular corresponding servlet will be
loaded.  If the values is <i>True</i>, the agent will contain the
following: <br>
[class of servlet loader, often
    org.cougaar.core.servlet.SimpleServletComponent](<i>'servlet class
    name','path'</i>)<br>
For a brief description of what these servlets are and the path at
which they will be available, see the text file
    which determines what servlets are available here:
    csmart/data/common/servlets.txt<br>
Also see the documentation on servlets in general, at 
doc/details/Servlets.html<br>

The above item will <b>NOT</b> be included if the value is <i>False</i><br>

<a name="TARGET_QUERY"><h3>Target Agent Selection Query</h3></a>
Specifies a defined query in a .q file.  This query is used to
selected the exact components that should be modified with this
recipe. Base, sample queries are in
CIP/csmart/data/common/PopulateDb.q<br>
Users should create their own queries in a file called
"recipeQueries.q", which should be placed someplace on the Cougaar
Config Path: in the directory from which you run CSMART, or in
CIP/csmart/data/common or CIP/configs/common, for example.<br>
<em>IMPORTANT: All recipes query names must begin with
"recipeQuery"!</em>
