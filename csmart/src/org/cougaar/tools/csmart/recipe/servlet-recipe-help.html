<h1>Servlet Group Insertion Recipe Configuration Help</h1>
The Servlet Group Insertion Recipe allows users to select groups of
individual servlets from the list of available servlets below.  These 
servlets can be added to individual agents as appropriate or to all agents 
based on the query selected by the user. The target query comes from the  
file 'PopulateDb.q' or the user created file 'recipeQueries.q'.

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<a name="SERVLET"><h3>Servlet</h3></a>
Specifies whether the particular corresponding servlet will be
loaded.  If the values is <i>True</i>, the agent will contain the
following: <br>
[class of servlet loader, often org.cougaar.core.servlet.SimpleServletComponent](<i>'servlet class name','path'</i>)<br>

The above item will <b>NOT</b> be included if the value is <i>False</i><br>

<a name="TARGET_QUERY"><h3>Target Agent Selection Query</h3></a>
Specifies a defined query in a .q file.  This query is used to
selected the exact components that should be modified with this
recipe. Base, sample queries are in
CIP/configs/common/PopulateDb.q<br>
Users should create their own queries in a file called
"recipeQueries.q", which should be placed somplace on the Cougaar
Config Path: in the directory from which you run CSMART, or in
CIP/configs/common, for example.<br>
<em>IMPORTANT: All recipes query names must begin with "recipeQuery"!</em><br>

<a name="NUM_SERV"><h3>_Number of New Servlets</h3></a>
The number of new servlets that you would like to add that are not included
in the list presented.  If you set this number to greater than 0 (and hit
return to set your selection), then a number of new fields appear, one
pair, appropriately numbered, for each new servlet you add:

<a name="CLASSNAME"><h3>Classname of Servlet Loader</h3></a>
The full classname of the servlet loader that you wish to add.  For example
for the PlanViewServlet and most others, the classname is as follows:<br>
org.cougaar.core.servlet.SimpleServletComponent<br>

<a name="ARG"><h3>Number of Servlet Arguments</h3></a>
The number of arguments that this servlet has. Usually this is two: one for the class of the actual servlet (ie org.cougaar.planning.servlet.PlanViewServlet), and one for the URI at which to contact the servlet.
Generally the path begins with a '/'. For example
for the PlanViewServlet, the path is as follows:<br>
/tasks<br>
If you set this number to greater than 0 (and hit
return to set your selection), then a number of new fields appear, one
for each servlet argument you specify:<br>

<a name ="NEW_SERV_ARG"><h3>New Servlet arg [#]</h3></a>
Here you may enter the value for each argument to your servlet. This
may be anything you like. As indicated above, typically the first
argument is the actual class of the servlet (for one that is loaded by
another class), and the second is the URI at which to contact the
servlet.<br>
