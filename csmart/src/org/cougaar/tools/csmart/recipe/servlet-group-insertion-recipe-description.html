The Servlet Group Insertion Recipe allows users to select groups of
individual servlets from the list of available servlets below.  These 
servlets can be added to individual agents as appropriate or to all agents 
based on the query selected by the user. The target query comes from the  
file 'PopulateDb.q' or the user created file 'recipeQueries.q'.
