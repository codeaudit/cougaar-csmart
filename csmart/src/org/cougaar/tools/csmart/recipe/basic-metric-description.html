<H1>Basic Metric Description</H1>
The Basic Metric collects basic run-time performance metrics. It can
be added to any society. It will collect several statistics, writing
the results out to a text file, which can be viewed in the <a href="../../ui/analyzer/help.html">Performance Analyzer.</a>.<br>
All entries are integers or Strings, or occasionally curly-brace
enclosed and comma-separated lists of Strings.<br><br>
See <a href="basic-metric-help.html">Basic Metric Help</a> for more information.<br>
