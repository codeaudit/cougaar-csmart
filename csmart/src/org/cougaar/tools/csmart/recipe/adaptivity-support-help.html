<h1>Adaptivity Support Recipe</h1>
Adaptivity Support Recipes allow users to insert Adaptivity Support
in any society at the set of places indicated by a database query. 
An Adaptivity Support Recipe contains the following parameters:
    <h2>Component Fields</h2>
    <table width="400">
	<tr>
	  <td><b>Name</b></td>
	  <td><b>Type</b></td>
	  <td><b>Range</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#TARGET_QUERY">Target Component Selection Query</a></td>
	  <td>String</td>
	  <td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><a href="#SERVLET">AEViewerServlet</a></td>
	  <td>Boolean</td>
	  <td>Indicate if the insertion should also include the AEViewServlet.</td>
	</tr>
    </table>  
    <br><br>

Creating an Adaptivity Support is an easy way to quickly add Adaptivity to
your agents.
<br><br>

<a name="TARGET_QUERY"><h3>Target Component Selection Query</h3></a>
Specifies a defined query in a .q file.  This query is used to
selected the exact components that should be modified with this
recipe. Base, sample queries are in
CIP/configs/common/PopulateDb.q<br>
Users should create their own queries in a file called
"recipeQueries.q", which should be placed someplace on the Cougaar
Config Path: in the directory from which you run CSMART, or in
CIP/configs/common, for example.<br>
<em>IMPORTANT: All recipes query names must begin with "recipeQuery"!</em><br>

<a name="SERVLET"><h3>AEViewerServlet</h3></a>
The AEViewerServlet is used for debugging the Adaptivity Support within an
Agent.
