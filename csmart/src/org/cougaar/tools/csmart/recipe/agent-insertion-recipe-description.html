The Agent Insertion Recipe allows users to create an arbitrary agent
for inclusion in a society, along with a skeletal Organization
Asset. In order to add plugins to the agent, use one of the other
Recipes, and be sure that the other recipe is listed <em>after</em>
this recipe in the Experiment Builder.<br>
All entries are integers or Strings, or occasionally curly-brace
enclosed and comma-separated lists of Strings.<br><br>
