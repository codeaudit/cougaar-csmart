The Component Collection Recipe allows users to create an arbitrary
collection of agents and plugins all with different
targets. Use the pop-up menus on the Nodes in the tree on the left to
add and remove components. At the root level, the target query (from
recipeQueries.q) specifies where the new (non-Agent) components will
be added. Sub-components can have their own target query, by selecting
the "Override Parent Target" pop-up menu option.<br>
All entries are integers or Strings, or occasionally curly-brace enclosed and comma-separated lists of Strings.<br>
