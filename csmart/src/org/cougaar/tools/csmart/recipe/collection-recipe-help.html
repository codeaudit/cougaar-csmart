<h2><font color="red">Documentation in progress.....</font></h2>
<p>With this recipe, you may build up an arbitrary collection of 
Agents and Plugins to add to a society. Agents will be available for 
assignment to Nodes as normal. Other Components will be inserted in
the Agents or NodeAgents you specify using the target query. Each
component can have its own Target Query, by selecting the "Override
Parent Target" menu option. Target queries are SQL queries defined in
CIP/configs/common/PopulateDb.q for the built-in queries, or in the
user-created file "recipeQueries.q" which should go in a similar
location. 
Note that Agents created with this recipe
will not have any Oplan related information in the database, if that
is important.
<p>To add an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the root folder.
<p>To remove an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the Agent folder.
<p>To add a Plugin, or Other Component, use the pop-up menu on
the root folder or the Agent folder, depending on where you want to
add it. The drop-down lists of components are editable, and are
populated from the list of Plugins / Binders currently known in the database.
<p>To edit a parameter in your Asset, edit the values in the right pane.
Within an Asset, you may add Relationships or
PropertyGroups. For each case, to add another one, use the
corresponding pop-up menu.
<p>To add a Parameter to or remove a Plugin, Binder, or Other
Component, use the pop-up menu on that component. When adding
parameters to these components, parameters are automatically named so
that they will be added at runtime in the order in which you add them
here, named "param-0", "param-1", etc.
<p>When adding parameters to PropertyGroups,
you will be asked for a parameter name. Note that the names of
parameters of Property Groups include the type of Object used to fill
in that value. For example, OrganizationPG has one Parameter, whose name is:<br>
Roles (Role)<br>
and whose value is a list, something like "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider". This means that the slot in
the PropertyGroup is called "Roles", and the Java Class of each object
is "Role". In this case, there are many values, so the slot contains a
Collection.<br>
The "INI" equivalent lines would be something like:<br>
<pre>[OrganizationPG]
Roles                    Collection&lt;Role&gt;       "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider"
</pre><br>
<b>Spelling errors, referring to a non-existent field
or Property Group, or other errors will not be noticed until runtime.</b>
<p>To remove a parameter, use the pop-up menu on that parameter. Note
that the remaining parameters will continue to be added according to
the numbers given in their names.
<p>Times should be specified in a standard Java parsable format, eg:
MM/DD/YY HH:MI AM.
<p>Elements in a collection should be separated by a comma and a space.
<p>Components within agents now have a <tt>Priority</tt> field.  The priority
indicates the load priority of the component in it's container relative to
other children components loaded at the same time at the same containment point.

The default component priority is: <tt>COMPONENT</tt>
