<BODY><H1>Component Collection Recipe</H1>
<p>With this recipe, you may build up an arbitrary collection of 
Components to add to a society. Agent Components will be available for 
assignment to Nodes as normal. Other Components will be inserted in
the Agents or NodeAgents you specify using the target query. <br>
Off the top-level Node, you can specify the general target for all
non-Agent components you add with this recipe (default is to add them
nowhere). Later, when you add other non-Agent components, they will be
added to all locations specified by this query.  Each
component can have its own Target Query, by selecting the "Override
Parent Target" popup menu option off of that component in the Tree on
the left. In this case, the component will be added only where this
override target query specifies. Target queries are SQL queries
defined in 
CIP/configs/common/PopulateDb.q for the built-in queries, or in the
user-created file "recipeQueries.q" which should go in a similar
location. Note that Agents are assigned using the Experiment Builder
as normal. </p>
<p>When adding a Component at the top level, to be added where your
target query specifies, although the menu item says "Add Plugin", you
can in fact add any arbitrary (non-Agent) component you like.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: The agents do not contain an OrgAsset by default.  This will
result in the agent not being visible from the Society Monitor.  If
an OrgAsset is added, be sure to add the OrgData
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgDataPlugin</code>) and
OrgReport
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgReportPlugin</code>)
plugins, and include a ClusterPG, ItemIdentificationPG, and
TypeIdentificationPG on your Asset. See below.</i>
<br>
<p>Within an Agent, there are 4 Categories in which you may add
components: Plugins, Binders (of Plugins), Other Components (whose
insertion point falls within the Agent), and Asset Data (ie Entity or
Organization Assets).

<p>To add an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the top-level folder.
<p>To remove an Agent, use the pop-up menu on the Agent folder.
<p>To add a Plugin, Binder, or Other Component, use the pop-up menu on
that folder to add it within an Agent, or off the top-level folder to
add a Component to be added to other Agents. The drop-down lists of
components are editable, and are
populated from the list of Plugins / Binders currently known in the
database.
<p>Components within agents now have a <tt>Priority</tt> field.  The
priority
indicates the load priority of the component in it's container
relative to
other children components loaded at the same time at the same
containment point.

The default component priority is: <tt>COMPONENT</tt>, and for Binders
it should usually be <tt>BINDER</tt>.<br>

<p>To edit a parameter in your Asset, edit the values in the right pane.
Within an Asset, you may add Relationships or
PropertyGroups. For each case, to add another one, use the
corresponding pop-up menu.
<p>To add a Parameter to or remove a Plugin, Binder, or Other
Component, use the pop-up menu on that component. When adding
parameters to these components, parameters are automatically named so
that they will be added at runtime in the order in which you add them
here, named "param-0", "param-1", etc.
<br>
<b>General Editing</b>
<i>To specify multiple values for a parameter, you
<b>must</b> enclose the list of comma-separated values in curly-braces
or square brackets.</i><br>
<b>Spelling errors, referring to a non-existent field
or Property Group, or other errors will not be noticed until runtime.</b>
<p>To remove a parameter, use the pop-up menu on that parameter. Note
that the remaining parameters will continue to be added according to
the numbers given in their names.
<p>Times should be specified in a standard Java parsable format, eg:
MM/DD/YY HH:MI AM.
<p>Elements in a collection should be separated by a comma and a
space, and the entire list enclosed by curly-braces or square brackets.
<br><br>

<b>AssetData</b>
<p>When adding parameters to PropertyGroups,
you will be asked for a parameter name and a type (Java class). Note
that the names of parameters of Property Groups, once displayed,
include the type of Object used to fill in that value. For example,
OrganizationPG has one Parameter, whose name is:<br> 
Roles (Role)<br>
and whose value is a list, something like "{TransportationProvider,
StrategicTransportationProvider}". This means that the slot in 
the PropertyGroup is called "Roles", and the Java Class of each object
is "Role". In this case, there are many values enclosed in curly
braces or square brackets, so the slot contains a
Collection. 
The "INI" equivalent lines would be something like:<br>
<pre>[OrganizationPG]
Roles    Collection&lt;Role&gt;   "TransportationProvider, StrategicTransportationProvider"
</pre>

<h2>Adding an Agent Asset</h2>

To have a working organization when doing an agent asset addition, you
must include the following: 

<h3>Asset Class</h3>
Something like "Military Organization". Be sure the default asset
class is correct, edit as needed.

<h3>Unique Id</h3>
Be sure the Unique Id is correct, edit as needed.

<h3> Property Groups: </h3>
The following must be added:<br><br>

<b>TypeIdentificationPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>TypeIdentification String <i>(value usually the UTC of the
agent)</i></b><br>
* <b>Nomenclature String <i>(optional)</i></b><br>
* <b>AlternateTypeIdentification String <i>(optional)</i></b>

<br><br>
<b>ClusterPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>ClusterIdentifier ClusterIdentifier <i>AgentName</i></b>

<br><br>
<b>ItemIdentificationPG</b><br>
with the following parameters:<br>
* <b>ItemIdentification String <i>AgentName</i></b><br>
* <b>Nomenclature String <i>(optional)</i></b>

<br><br>
<b>Org related Plugins</b><br>
You must also include the 2 org-related Plugins for your OrgAsset
(Asset Data) to be loaded at runtime. 
These are the OrgData
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgDataPlugin</code>) and 
OrgReport 
(<code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.OrgReportPlugin</code>) 
Plugins (which take no arguments).<br>
