<h1>Adaptivity Support Recipe</h1>

An Adaptivity Support Recipe allows the insertion of all pieces required
for adaptivity support.  The target component query comes from the file PopulateDb.q
or the user created file recipeQueries.q

The <code>PlaybookManager</code> plugin requires a file, located on the
config path, which defines the plays it will use. By default, that
file will be: <code><i>AgentName</i>-plays.txt</code> for each agent into which adaptivity support
is added. You may specify another plays file name, in which case all
Agents will use the same plays file.
