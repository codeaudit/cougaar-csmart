<h1>Adaptivity Support Recipe</h1>

An Adaptivity Support Recipe allows the insertion of all pieces required
for adaptivity support.  The target component query comes from the file PopulateDb.q
or the user created file recipeQueries.q

The <pre>PlaybookManager</pre> plugin requires a file, located on the config path
of: <pre><i>AgentName</i>-plays.txt</pre>  for each agent into which adaptivity support
is added.
