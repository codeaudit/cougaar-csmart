<h1>ABC Society Configuration Help</h1>
<p>The ABC Society uses abstract domain plugins to generate an
arbitrarily large and complex society, which behaves like a logistics
supply chain.<br>
The Society is organized by Communities, which pass Tasks between
them. Each community consists of four Agents. Two of these Agents are
Customers which periodically inject new demand Tasks into the system. They are
supplied by a Provider1 with some local asset capacity. If that Agent
cannot fulfill the requests, they are allocated to the Provider2
within that community.<br>
If the Provider2 cannot fulfill the task locally, it allocates the task to the
Provider2 in another Community, depending how the supply relationships
have been established.<br>
This society works in a purely execution mode: all tasks are matched against assets, and responses are always given with high confidence eventually. In particular, Tasks include deadlines for completion, and often requests will fail due to the deadline being exceeded.<br>
<br>
To build an ABC Society, you must specify parameters at several
different levels. Note that all parameters have defaults, so that
modifications at all levels are not required.<br>
You may edit parameters at the following levels:<ul>
<li><a href="#soclevel">Society Level</a>: Specify overall control
parameters.</li>
<li><a href="#commlevel">Community Level</a>: Control each community
overall.</li>
<li><a href="#agentlevel">Agent Level</a>: Some Agent specific
parameters.</li>
<li><a href="#alloclevel">Allocation Level</a>: Control how
allocations in this Agent work.</li>
<li><a href="#rulelevel">Rule Level</a>: Edit the allocation rules in
this Agent.</li>
<li><a href="#tasklevel">Tasks Level</a>: Control how root tasks are issued
in this Agent.</li>
<li><a href="#locassetlevel">Local Asset Level</a>: Specify the capacity and functioning of the local asset in this Agent.</li>
</ul>

<a NAME="soclevel"><h2>Society Level</h2></a>

The society level consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Community Count        [Integer, (Level Count) - MAX]</li>
<li>Level Count                  [Integer, 1 - MAX]</li>
<li>Max number of metric samples     [Integer, 0 - MAX]</li>
<li>Metric sample interval           [Integer, seconds, 0 - 60]</li>
<li>Metric start delay               [ Integer, seconds, 0 -  MAX]</li>
<li>Start Time (relative)            [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX]</li>
<li>Stop Time (relative)             [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX]</li>
<li>Task Verb                   [ String ]</li>
</ul>
An ABC Society consists of one or more communities.  Each Community contains 4 agents 
(2 customer agents and 2 provider agents).  A society attempts to maintain a 
basic hourglass construction of communities by dividing the communities among levels.  
By default, there are 5 communities and three levels.  This results in 2 Communities on 
Level 1, 1 Community on 
Level 2 and 2 Communities on Level 3.  Changing the 'Community Count' or 
changing the 'Level Count' will regenerate a new community with an attempt
to preserve the hourglass topology.
There must always be at least as many communities as levels.
<br>
There are two types of agents within a society.  Customer agents and Provider 
agents.  Customer agents produce tasks and provider agents contain the assets 
to satisfy the task request.  Currently we only support one 'Task Verb' which 
is defined in the Society level.  Multiple Task verbs will be supported in
a future interim release.  Tasks are submitted between 'Start 
Time' and 'Stop Time'  Tasks start getting generated at 'Start Time' + the 
current time and continue until 'Stop Time' + current time.  <br>
Throughout task production, metrics are collected for each agent.  Once the 
agent is started, it will start producing metrics at 'Metrics: Start Delay' + 
current time.  The agent will then continue to report its metrics at every 
interval 'Metrics: Sample Interval' (seconds) until the requested number of metrics samples
'Metrics: Maximum Number of Samples' are collected.<br>

<a NAME="commlevel"><h2>Community Level</h2></a>

The community level consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Demand               [ Integer, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Latitude                [ Float, -90 - 90 ]</li>
<li>Longitude             [ Float -180 - 180 ]</li>
<li>Production            [ Integer, 0 - MAX ]</li>
</ul>
Each community has a specific amount of production and demand associated with 
it.  The 'Demand' is proportional to the number of tasks produced by the customers within the 
community.  The higher the demand, the more tasks produced.  'Production' is 
proportional to the amount of inventory on hand in the community.  Producers that contain a local inventory satisfy all Tasks for which they have remaining capacity.  Once the inventory is delpeted, the Task must be satisified elsewhere (until the local inventory has been re-supplied).  
Increasing the amount of Production in 
a community increases the local inventory levels, which will eliminate the 
need for tasks to be satisfied by other communities.<br>
Each community also has a location associated with it.  This location 
specified with 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' is the center of the community.  All
agent locations are specified from the center of the community.<br>

<a NAME="agentlevel"><h2>Agent Level</h2></a>

The Agent level consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Direction    [ Float, degrees from North, 0-360 ]</li>
<li>Distance    [ Integer, meters, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Supplies    [ String[] of agent names]</li>
</ul>
As indicated above, every agent is given a location relative to the center of 
the community.  These are specified in 'Direction' and Distance', where 
distance is the number of meters from the center of the community and 
direction is the degrees relative to North from the center of the community.<br>
Each agent also has a 'Supplies' property.  This property lists all the agents 
(by fully qualified agent name) for which this agent serves as a provider (this agent will be an 
organization that the listed agent can allocate its Tasks).  
Customer agents do not have any local Assets, and this value is empty.<br>

<a NAME="alloclevel"><h2>The Allocation Level</h2></a>

The allocation level consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Estimated execute Time             [ Long, milliseconds,  0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Number of Allocation Rules         [ Long, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Allocation Publish Time              [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Response (Estimated Allocation Result) Publish Time          [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Allocation Confidence Required  [ Float, 0 - 1 ]</li>
<li>Estimated Transport Time           [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
</ul>
All agents have an allocation table.  This table is used to allocate all the 
tasks of which this agent is aware.   The Allocator can try to
calculate reduced Task deadlines, based on estimates of the time to
execute an Allocation, etc. By asking downstream components to
complete a Task within reduced times, the Allocator hopes to have
sufficient time to send a response the original customer, or perhaps
attempt another Allocation if this one fails. <br>
The 'Execute Time' is an estimate of the time it will actually take to satisfy the Task, once allocated to an actual asset.  The time it takes the 
allocator to publish an allocation is controlled by 'Publish Time'.  The 
time for the Allocator to publish a simple response is controlled by 'Response Time''.  The 
'Transport Time' indicates the estimated amount of time it will take for the allocator 
to transport the allocation to the remote agent.  The confidence required of Allocation Results received by the Allocator, for them to be considered confident enough to act on, is 
controlled by 'Successful Allocation', with 0 indicating that all allocation results will be considered confident, and 1 indicating that only those specifying complete confidence will be accepted.<br>
Each Allocation table has a number of Allocation Rules associated with it.  The amount of rules within the allocation table are controlled by 'Number of Allocation Rules'.  When new rules are added to the allocation table, they are added as empty rules.  It is
up to the CSMART user to fill in the Roles and Task verb for each new rule. (See The Rule Level). <br>

<a NAME="rulelevel"><h2>The Rule Level</h2></a>

The rule level consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Roles             [ String [] ]</li>
<li>Task Verb     [ String ]</li>
</ul>
All agents can have multiple allocation rules.  Each rule consists of a 'Task 
Verb' to allocate and a list of the 'Roles' required of an Asset to be
able to allocate this Task verb to it (all listed rules must be
present). Multiple rules for the same task verb are permissible. Later
rules will usually be for less dependable, or increasingly remote
Assets or Organizations.<br>

<a NAME="tasklevel"><h2>The Tasks Level</h2></a>

The Task level contains 1 or more children.  (Currently only one is 
supported.) Each child represents a specific task verb that agent should generate.  (Note: Only Customer agents generate Tasks.)  <br>

Each task consists of the following properties:<ul>
<li>Chaos Factor            [ Integer, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Deadline                   [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Interval between Tasks       [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Task Verb                [ String ]</li>
<li>Vitalness (of Task to customer) Factor       [ Float, 0 - 1 ]</li>
</ul>
When the customer agent is started, it starts to submit a task of verb 'Task Verb' to 
be satisfied.  Tasks are repeatedly submitted at a specified 'Interval' 
from the start time until the stop time of the society.  Some amount of 
variability can be applied to the Interval by increasing the 'Chaos Factor' 
for the task.  The larger the Chaos Factor, the more variable the interval 
will be.  Each task must be completed by a specific time.  This time is 
specified with 'Deadline'  The deadline is the amount of time after the task 
has been submitted by which it must be completed.  If the task is not completed 
by the deadline, the customer's overall happiness will decrease.  The amount 
this value decreases for each unsuccessful task is controlled by the "Vitalness 
Factor"  The higher the vitalness, the unhappier the customer becomes if the Task fails.<br>

<a NAME="locassetlevel"><h2>The Local Asset Level</h2></a>

The local asset level has the following properties:
<UL>
<li>Asset Name               [ String ]</li>
<li>Average Execute Time             [ Long, milliseconds, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Inventory Decrement Percent      [ Long, 0 - 100 ]</li>
<li>Inventory Decrement Deviation       [ Long, 0 - MAX ]</li>
<li>Roles                            [ String [] ]</li>
<li>Time Deviation             [ Long, 0 - MAX ]</li></ul>

Every provider agent contains a local asset.  This asset is used to satisfy 
task requests.  The name of the local asset, 'Asset Name' is just an 
identifier and is not used for anything within the system.  Every asset 
contains an inventory level. When the asset is used to satisfy a task 
request, the inventory level decreases.  The decrement amount for each Task 
completion depends on the 'Decrement Amount' parameter.
The larger the decrement amount, the quicker the inventory can be depleted. The 
inventory level can also have a certain amount of chaos applied to it by 
changing the 'Inventory Deviation' parameter (for example, stock loss due to fire or theft).  
This chaotic inventory perturbation is applied before every inventory request. The larger the deviation, the 
more variability in the current inventory level. With an 'Inventory 
Deviation' of 0, the reported inventory level is the exactly calculable from the previous requests of that asset.  <br>
Each local asset can satisfy specific roles.  The roles that the asset can 
satisfy are indicated in 'Roles'.  Note that an asset must list all of the roles required of it by the Allocation Rules above for it to be used for a given task verb.<br>
When an asset is used to satisfy a task, it takes a specific amount 
of time to complete the task request.  This time is controlled by 'Average 
Time'.  This time amount also controls how rapidly the local stock is refilled after a request.  By adjusting the 'Time Deviation' value, the time taken to satisfy a Task will vary randomly (Gaussian, as all our chaos factors are).  The larger the value, the more variable the time.<br>
