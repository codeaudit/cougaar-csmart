<h1>Basic Metric Configuration Help</h1>
The Basic Metric collects rudimentary run-time performance metrics for any society to which it is added. The results can then be viewed in the Performance Analyzer.<br>
<ul>
<li>Max number of metric samples     [Integer, 0 - MAX]</li>
<li>Metric sample interval           [Integer, seconds, 0 - 60]</li>
<li>Metric start delay               [ Integer, seconds, 0 -  MAX]</li>
</ul>
Throughout task production, metrics are collected for each agent.  Once the 
agent is started, it will start producing metrics at 'Metrics: Start Delay' + 
current time.  The agent will then continue to report its metrics at every 
interval 'Metrics: Sample Interval' (seconds) until the requested number of metrics samples
'Metrics: Maximum Number of Samples' are collected.<br>
