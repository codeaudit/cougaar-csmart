<h1>Basic Metric Configuration Help</h1>
The Basic Metric collects rudimentary run-time performance metrics for any society to which it is added. The results can then be viewed in the Performance Analyzer.<br>
<ul>
<li>Max number of metric samples     [Integer, 0 - MAX]</li>
<li>Metric sample interval           [Integer, seconds, 0 - 60]</li>
<li>Metric start delay               [Integer, seconds, 0 -  MAX]</li>
<li>Task Verb                        [String]</li>
<li>Blackboard Statistics Service On/Off  [Integer, 0 or 1]</li>
<li>Prototype Registry Service On/Off     [Integer, 0 or 1]</li>
<li>Node Metrics Service On/Off     [Integer, 0 or 1]</li>
<li>Message Stats Service On/Off     [Integer, 0 or 1]</li>
<li>Message Watcher Service On/Off     [Integer, 0 or 1]</li>
</ul>
Throughout task production, metrics are collected for each agent.  Once the 
agent is started, it will start producing metrics at 'Metrics: Start Delay' + 
current time.  The agent will then continue to report its metrics at every 
interval 'Metrics: Sample Interval' (seconds) until the requested number of metrics samples
'Metrics: Maximum Number of Samples' are collected.<br>
The remaining parameters allow you to customize which metrics are
collected.<br>
<b>FIXME!!!</b>
Standard statistics always collected include:<br>
Sample length in seconds<br>
CPU seconds used by Node during sample<br>
(NOTE: This CPU statistic required the separate CpuClock shared library,
included with the scalability module.  See the Scalability module's install
instructions for installing the CpuClock library. If you do not install
this library, you will see a warning exception, which can be ignored.<br>
<br>
Memory used by Node in Megabytes<br>
Total memory allocated to the Node in megabytes<br>
<br>
The Task Verb parameter allows you to request that the
plugin count the tasks with the given Verb that go by.<br>
It will also count the time since the first task with that Verb went by.<br>
For example, use this to count the Transport tasks, or to see how long
after a DetermineRequirements Task things get busy.<br>
The three new statistics you get are:<br>
Time since first Task with the Verb<br>
Number of Tasks in this interval with the verb<br>
Total Tasks seen with the verb<br>
<br>
Other statistics are gathered from the various services which provide
measurements.<br>
These statistics can be turned on/off via the additional optional 1/0 arguments.<br>
By default however, only the basic set of statistics is gathered.<br>
First, Blackboard statistics (off by default): <br>
Count of Assets on this Agent's Blackboard<br>
PlanElements on this Blackboard<br>
Tasks on the Blackboard<br>
Total Objects on this Blackboard<br>
<br>
Prototype Registry (off by default):<br>
Cached Prototypes<br>
Property Providers<br>
Prototype Providers<br>
<br>
Node Metrics (off by default): <br>
Active threads in the COUGAAR group (a per-Node stat)<br>
Free memory (bytes) in this Node's allocation<br>
Total memory (bytes) in this Node's allocation<br>
<br>
Then come some statistics recorded only if the MessageStatisticsService was requested,
which is the default setting:<Br>
Message Queue Length (a per-Node statistic)<br>
MessageBytes Sent (per-Node)<br>
Messages sent (per-Node)<br>
<br>
Message Watcher (off by default): <br>
Directives received by this Agent<br>
Directives sent<br>
Notifications received by this Agent<br>
Notifications sent by this Agent<br>
