The Basic Metric collects basic run-time performance metrics. It can
be added to any society. It will collect several statistics, writing
the results out to a text file, which can be viewed in the Performance
Analyzer.<br>
All entries are integers or Strings, or occasionaly curly-brace
enclosed and comma-separated lists of Strings.<br>
